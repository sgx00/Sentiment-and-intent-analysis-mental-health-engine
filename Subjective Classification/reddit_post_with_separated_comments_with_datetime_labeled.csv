doesnt delusion voice psychosis actually experiencing kinda confusing,SUBJECTIVE
1 develops delusion dont deny delusion reality try asking question instead let say he hearing voice coming outside something deal ask seems reasonable assume person outside house stranger le would try talking someone inside house key get think delusion come conclusion important keep love understanding heart ask question patient delusion powerful thing knack adapting proof 2 would want partner understand may need alone time process thing everyone different know many time needed curl cover shut world hour even whole day 3 psychosis broadly speaking isnt common isnt case everyone people initial episode never another one people many episode last month time proper medication however chance slipping psychosis drastically reduced slip psychosis best thing ask he feeling he thinking may uncomfortable ask he thought harming others take hospital hospital fun even borderline traumatic case safe environment stabilize he longer threat others thats hospital there shame trigger answer unfortunately many thing biggest offender recreational drug first psychotic break canabis induced example simple put recreational drug arent worth risk risk factor include stress anxiety physical trauma 4 common treatment medicine therapy im antipsychotic mood stabilizer antidepressant couple med help mitigate side effect also weekly meeting counselor therapist biweekly meeting doctor ive learned great deal brain work handle symptom texas called mhmr center basically state funded clinic low income people need mental health support literally saved life check local area assistance,SUBJECTIVE

would say get paranoid delusional gently encourage speak dr think partner said something like dont see way maybe talk x would inclined seek help straight told wrong would probably push back start trust anti psychotic typical treatment good find right one therapy helped lot sometimes good talk thing better understanding wouldnt good without guess would want partner know sometimes need process life may become distant doesnt mean dont love care need time opinion though everyone different different experience,SUBJECTIVE
