"I am really sorry you are experiencing this. I personally struggle with an eating disorder and examining my deep and consistent desire for control has been key to my recovery. I think recovery comes easier with a balance of embracing and letting go of what we cannot control, while practicing a healthy degree of “control” or I like to say exercising choice, over one’s life and day to day activities and experiences, this definitely includes what we use to cook, what and how we eat, how we provide food for ourselves.  I will start by saying that the desire to control often comes from living through many experiences where control, really a sense of self, whether an ability to enact one’s will, one’s preference and choice, a sense of independence, efficacy, confidence, personal space, etc. was not available, not respected, not practiced, etc. I am sorry if you have experienced times where your voice, your body, your self, were quieted or dismissed, no one deserves that. Using your own voice and decision making etc to live out your own, ideally healthy, desires, dreams, lifestyle etc can help establish a stronger sense of self, which can quiet the craving for control. Practice this beyond food, exercise your unique and strong voice.  Is it possible for you to ask for very specific and realistic things, whether it be groceries, recipe modifications, guidelines on when you can use the kitchen space etc from your family? Your family unfortunately might not be in a place of understanding and supporting your mental and physical health needs (which means reaching out to those who can support you in any way is so important right now), but they might be able to understand that you are experiencing anxiety, depression, “stress” generally, discomfort generally etc,. And that these changes will help you feel better. If they are not in a place of understanding and or listening, stay very specific like “can we please use ___ instead of butter to cook __?” And if that is a problem or people bother you for a justification, keep it simple to this is what would make me feel better, make a simple reason  like I just would like to try it, and if they keep pestering, stay firm and say I would like to use xx so I will plan on cooking my own meal etc and will either join you all or eat separately etc. however I would also try to remain open to the possibility that they might understand a little bit, I would hope to the extent to respecting and understanding you saying “this is what I need right now, thank you”  Remember that you do not owe anyone an explanation but sometimes you do have to be your own advocate to get the things you need. I wish I could say that I have had a lot of familial and/or professional, structural support with my ED- this can help tremendously, but I have not and I still struggle. However I have tapped in to practices of self care, meditation, healthy exercise, becoming friends with myself, opening up to others who care and love me, and I have made huge strides in recovery and see it as an ongoing process. So in case you don’t have this support either and relate, remember that you are not alone and that you can get through this, and that you deserve access to foods that nourish you and make you feel all around good, energized and alive, you deserve peace, love, and to experience joy.  I hope you can ask for/get access to some of the foods and things that will help you feel better asap. People are quick to dismiss these changes and choices as petty etc but choice means a lot to everyone and it really means a lot to someone struggling with an ED. I hope the choices and specifics you ask for and get are truly good for you. I encourage you to be open minded and challenge narratives that limit and restrict the foods you deem appropriate for your consumption— you are a human being, don’t hold yourself to a different standard, and you deserve to enjoy the foods you eat. All the best to you.",EatingDisorders,positive,really sorry experiencing personally struggle eating disorder examining deep consistent desire control key recovery think recovery come easier balance embracing letting go can not control practicing healthy degree “ control ” like say exercising choice one ’ s life day day activity experience definitely includes use cook eat provide food start saying desire control often come living many experience control really sense self whether ability enact one ’ s one ’ s preference choice sense independence efficacy confidence personal space etc available respected practiced etc sorry experienced time voice body self quieted dismissed one deserves using voice decision making etc live ideally healthy desire dream lifestyle etc help establish stronger sense self quiet craving control practice beyond food exercise unique strong voice possible ask specific realistic thing whether grocery recipe modification guideline use kitchen space etc family family unfortunately might place understanding supporting mental physical health need mean reaching support way important right might able understand experiencing anxiety depression “ stress ” generally discomfort generally etc change help feel better place understanding listening stay specific like “ can please use instead butter cook ” problem people bother justification keep simple would make feel better make simple reason like would like try keep pestering stay firm say would like use xx plan cooking meal etc either join eat separately etc however would also try remain open possibility might understand little bit would hope extent respecting understanding saying “ this need right thank you ” remember owe anyone explanation sometimes advocate get thing need wish could say lot familial andor professional structural support ed help tremendously still struggle however tapped practice self care meditation healthy exercise becoming friend opening others care love made huge stride recovery see ongoing process case don ’ t support either relate remember alone get deserve access food nourish make feel around good energized alive deserve peace love experience joy hope ask forget access food thing help feel better asap people quick dismiss change choice petty etc choice mean lot everyone really mean lot someone struggling ed hope choice specific ask get truly good encourage open minded challenge narrative limit restrict food deem appropriate consumption— human don ’ t hold different standard deserve enjoy food eat best,SUBJECTIVE

"I feel for you bro. If this makes you feel any peace at all, I went through a similar experience with my dad in 2018. Pancreatic cancer he was diagnosed with, stage 4, end term, after a few weeks of awful abdominal/back pain which got written off as something else, until his actual GP came back from leave JUST to see him as his doc was suspicious about his symptoms. He got dad to do a scan that day of his pancreas’s, and bam, a huge tumour on his pancreas / bile duct that had spread to his liver, it was over.   Got a call interstate from my brother about three months later, as dad was living interstate and refused to let us stay with him (I’ll get to that) and he was rushed to hospital, and my sister heard dads ambulance go past her exact apartment on the road she was living on, which we confirmed was dads ambulance, lights and sirens, he was being rushed to hospital with sepsis, kidney failure and was put straight on dialysis.   Was told he would have a good outcome, we came that night and I rushed in to hospital only to be met with dad coming out of a stent surgery screaming in agony with blood pouring out of his eyes, reaching out for me but I couldn’t do anything, I wasn’t allowed to touch him due to chemotherapy absolutely destroying his immune system and him already having sepsis he couldn’t be near many people until he was put on IV antibiotics .   Second day he was sitting up, scrolling through his phone and mum, my sister, my brother and I walked in to see him. For the first time in my life back then, I saw dad’s true colours . He was narcissistic in his old self and ways, but on his deathbed his soul came out. He revealed his good soul, which mum and I always knew he had. He said to the nurse, “this is my beautiful wife and children, I’m such a lucky man”. He had never told us this in his entire life, ever, up until then. I had just turned 20.   Second day we came in, dad was unconscious and gasping for air, we couldn’t believe it. He had turned extremely jaundiced (yellow) from the tumour blocking his bile duct in his pancreas’s, and his kidneys not functioning and not cleaning toxins and bilirubin buildup in his body. There was a woman, a very “cosmetically enhanced” woman sitting next to dad. Mum and dad were still married during all this, but estranged. Dad wouldn’t ever allow mum to divorce him. Anyway, the nurse on duty that day asked if my mum was my dads daughter (mum looks young for her age, and dad was 20 years older), she goes no, I’m his wife actually. The nurse frowned, and teared up. I will never forget how caring that ICU nurse was. She had been doing that job for over 35 years and told us this happens very often. Skeletons come out of the closet when people are close to death, or during their funerals. It happens all the time. It doesn’t make it any less easier, but just know you’re never alone.   Dad had been living interstate on “business” on and off for 12 years, but in fact, after he died the next day, we had found out he had been living in a mansion with this woman who was a notorious gold digger, and her ex husband we later found out died of exactly the same cancer and was wealthy and our lawyer dug up documents that she had gone to court with her ex “ de facto” husbands kids for the entire inheritance. We said our goodbyes to dad, as he laid there with his mouth open, lifeless and completely jaundiced, and went home.   I walked along the busy main road with dad’s plastic bag of all he had left and came to hospital in. His track pants, slippers and his watch and a jumper. I could smell the chemotherapy coming off his body and clothes, I walked home sobbing. Carrying my father’s last memories in his last days in a pathetic, crinkled up plastic bag. I can’t even describe how awful that felt, as my family had to go get supplies as we had 0 food to eat as we came and went straight in to hospital from the airport.   We viewed dads body in the funeral home TWO weeks after his death as he had to be transported via boat interstate to us, where his final wish was to be buried, and it didn’t look like him. I don’t know being two weeks like that, even when you’re preserved, you’d look like that. He was bloated and still yellow. I was having severe flashbacks by his coffin, and that awful woman he was with was hovering over me and my mother, as we kissed dad goodbye and held his hands that still had ice on them from the morgue.   Soon after the funeral, dad’s mistress gold digger filed a claim against his estate wanting 3.5 million dollars, his 3.7 million dollar house and his Mercedes, he hid it all from us, all his life, even my mum. She ended up getting 1 million of money that was meant to go to my mother, who had despite knowing dad was unfaithful, stayed by his side and my sister, mine, and my half brothers side when he was younger, the entire time. She is still to this day, traumatised and stuck. Just as I am. I have gone through hell after his death. Drugs, self harm, all sorts of things. But I have gotten better.   I just want to say this all may not happen to you at all regarding what happens after if your beloved father enters heaven, but just know, whatever happens, things get easier and better, with time. It won’t be easy at first, prepare, the best way you can, it’s ok to cry, it’s ok to feel like you’re having outer body experiences, but just know, with time, you’ll be able to function again and love your life. You will be ok, and your dad would want that for you.   I wish you, your family and your father all of gods blessing and the best of luck.

I'm talking exposed insulation and studs, no trim, broken door frames, holes in the ceiling. To top it off, it's my trauma-filled childhood home.  Fixing it up has been so cathartic for me. Literally tearing my trauma apart. Taking out some anger on the broken-down pool deck has also helped. lol.  On the other side of the spectrum, My brother who is a big mishmash of all kinds of mental troubles has not found solace in medication. He was on too many medications and it caused him to go into psychosis and do some terrible things that he doesn't even remember doing. We're no contact now.  He also tried to fix up the house but I think the difference was our intent. He wasn't fixing it for HIM, he wanted to rent it out some day. I'm fixing the house for ME and I think it's freeing rather than suffocating.  Less is more in my uneducated opinion, but again, everyone is different!

"First of all, it sounds like you are an incredibly compassionate and caring parent trying to handle this the right way, so major kudos to you. Your daughter is lucky to have you and I'm so sorry you both are going through this.  Obviously different tactics work for different kids, but for me I think permission to eat was most effective. I saw your original post and it sounds like she is a parent-pleaser, and I know for me it would only cause more anxiety if I felt I was letting down or disappointing my parents. Remember, the eating disorder voice in her head is telling her that food is scary and bad and is going to scream at her if she eats.  Personally I think the best thing you can do is to keep reassuring her that she can eat, that her body needs it.  Maybe asking her: Does it seem scary to eat this? What would make it less scary? Positive reinforcement if she does eat might also be helpful (""We are so proud of you for taking a bite, do you think you could take one more?"") Another suggestion is to provide distractions when or after eating so that she's not sitting with feelings of guilt.  I'm just speaking from personal experience, so take these suggestions with a grain of salt, but I hope they help!  As a recovery advocate, I've recently been doing some research on eating disorder literature and I might also suggest you check out the book ""Brave Girl Eating"" by Harriet Brown. It's a memoir by a mother whose daughter struggled with severe anorexia, and I think it offers a really eye-opening and research-backed look at the disease but also might help you feel less alone and ultimately hopeful that you can get through this. I know it can be triggering for some patients to consume content about eating disorders, but there is also a middle grade book about a little girl's eating disorder recovery journey called Good Enough (Jen Petro Roy) that I think does a really good job of framing eating disorders in a way that kids can understand, if you are ever interested in looking into that.

You're not disgusting. You should win a medal for even going to the dentist. You did what I have an intense fear of so I commend you. You got up you got ready you left the house and did what I would consider a really bad time.  Based on natural bodily functions I'm assuming you go to the bathroom at some point in the day. Most houses have sinks next to the toilet perhaps put your toothbrush and paste on the sink counter (keep the toilet lid closed) so when you wash your hands it just an extra second to brush your teeth.  It doesn't have to be exactly 2 minutes. 10 seconds is better than nothing. If you can't floss at that time then don't. Just do what you can.  I know the general consensus is rinse after you spit but if you look at Europe's dental recommendations they say rinsing isn't necessary (last i saw which was a long time ago) and can be beneficial since you're not washing out the fluoride right after you applied it. I started doing it and haven't had a cavity since plus no one reminds me to floss and I was getting 2+ cavities at every cleaning being guilt tripped about floss.  Buying a new toothbrush and some toothpaste you like might also help.

"(Sorry for my English, I'm using a translator)  A comment above questioned him about actually being a narcissist, having called himself that, and a legitimate narcissist, would never do that.  I disagree. I have a lot of contact with narcissists, both because I was a victim of one, also following the cases of very close friends of mine, who had relationships with people like this, and also because I study the subject.  Narcissists feel special because they are different. Many, in the height of their arrogance, consider narcissism as something positive, as it only reinforces their self-view of being special.  But in most cases, they reject the idea that they are narcissists. However, they often use this to victimize themselves, referring to themselves as narcissists, as someone with a problem, but they themselves do not believe it, they use this speech only to manipulate you, make you feel sorry, as if they were victims, and thereby justifying their abusive attitudes  Every victim of narcissism has the impression that they always get along well. Because they are highly manipulative, they give the impression that right after destroying their life, they find a new person, deceive that person, make it seem like they are a good guy/girl. While you are completely torn apart, trying to pick up the pieces, that person who destroyed you is there, with another, in an apparently happy relationship, as if nothing had happened. Feeling of injustice  But after this phase of anger, which is totally understandable, you will realize that this is just an illusion: The harsh and even sad reality is that a narcissist is condemned to self-sabotage throughout his life, with practically minimal chances of a cure, as there is no effective treatment for narcissistic personality disorder.  The vast majority of people can make a lot of mistakes, but they learn from their mistakes, make amends, and evolve. Most psychological disorders, if treated well, can be cured or even alleviated, as the person understands the problem, is willing to change behaviors, follow treatment and, when necessary, use medication, and with that, can have a full life, reasonably normal and free from suffering.  But not for a narcissist: As they are unable to understand and accept their own problem in 90%+ of cases, there is nothing they can do. And all their actions will inevitably lead them to ruin. It doesn't matter that they are great manipulators, so they can deceive people to obtain their own benefits (money, relationships, status), their high ego, their arrogance, their lack of empathy, their fetish for manipulating and controlling, and their true self: They are people empty of spirit, in the end, will ALWAYS lead them sooner or later to their downfall, in everything. You can sustain a lie for a long time for many people: But never forever. And narcissism, their essence, is precisely the lie.  Having said all that, what you can and should do is: Therapy. Not only to put the pieces back together, but to close the gaps: Narcissists only have relationships with people with psychological disorders. A narcissist will never stay with a healthy person for long. If a narcissist entered and established himself in your life, it is necessarily because he noticed your gaps and weaknesses, and used this to enter and establish himself.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy will help you identify these vulnerabilities and their origin. With this, you and your therapist will be able to chart a path so that you can improve, evolve as a person, increase your self-knowledge, putting a real barrier to abusive people's profiles (narcissists are not the only ones). You will realize that many of the reasons why you wonder why all this happened, their origins are there in the formation of your own personality, which took place in childhood.  And finally, obviously, cut off any contact with him. Don't allow him to come back into your life, you can be sure he will come back (yes, narcissists always look for their exes when they get things wrong), he will try to activate all your triggers to convince you to give him another chance. Don't allow yourself to have this relapse.  I think that's it.

"I'm so sorry you're hurting, missing your beloved friends.    When I was in the thick of recovery, I let a documentary channel play all night at first, then later, could set the tv timer to shut the tv off.  Not a nature channel, because there's ...too much ""nature"" where animals go after other animals.   I liked the history channel.  If I tried to focus on it, I could drift off, and somehow, my sleeping brain played more history than trauma.    You're grieving, and it's a completely normal and healthy response to loss through trauma.    Let yourself be non-destructively angry, sad, fearful and ...lonely for your friends.    I discovered that it helped so much to shout my lungs out into a pillow until exhausted, vocalizing and expending that energy until I was spent.  I don't know what it was about being vocal, but it really helped to get it out of my system.  I used a pillow so no one would call the cops.  Something physical helps, too, like beating the bed with a baseball bat.  Someone suggested a tennis racquet, but it just didn't have the *umph* of a bat.  If you do that, make sure the ""swing area"" is not going to damage your ceiling or anything else like ceiling fixtures.  Both helped me to be able to close my eyes, then listen to the tv, but it took a little time to *really* engage with those very difficult emotions, to start to purge enough of them for it to be effective.  There's nothing to lose by seeing if it helps you to get some rest.  PTSD is so very fatiguing.    And... just a reminder -  I doubt you were ""okay"" until the last one, but in a normal phase of PTSD, avoidance behaviors (like drinking) and emotional denial; both are natural survival responses to trauma.  The last one is likely where you began to come from denial, so they're all hitting you at once.  https://psychcentral.com/blog/denial-of-trauma-signs    https://integrativelifecenter.com/mental-health-treatment/what-are-the-stages-of-ptsd/    https://www.verywellmind.com/ptsd-and-emotional-avoidance-2797640    https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/what/avoidance.asp    Before the internet, I was in denial for 15 years.

"You have already almost done exactly this, but if I were you I would make a list of the things you hate about yourself. And then try to come up with a solution for all of those traits. Some of them you can't change, some of them you maybe could.  For instance:  - Ugly face -> Not much to do about it, except losing weight if you are fat and grow a beard.   - Shitty hairline -> Hair transplant. wig or shave   - Skinny / fat body -> Lose weight / Go to the gym and lift weights 3x per week   - No talents -> Cultivate one. Start playing guitar. Start drawing. And make goals for yourself such as 'I want to be able to play song x by the end of this year'   You have no reason to exist because you did not find your mission yet. You are just living from day to day, feeling your misery.  What about this for a mission? Become the best version of yourself possible. Both in terms of personality as looks wise. Besides that, stop living a life solely for your own pleasure but devote it to helping others. Start a family (in the long run, self improvement comes first). Go volunteer and help old or disabled people. Start a YouTube channel devoted getting out of this depression together with other's. I don't know. Anything that you can think of.  Life isn't supposed to be fun everyday. We aren't supposed to go like 'I'm so happy!' everyday. It's your mission that should get you through the day. Even if you feel like shit, you are going to go through with it. Go to the gym. Play that guitar. And help those other people. Then you will realise it doesn't matter how you feel. Your feelings are irrelevant. You are going to get it done anyway.  And before you know it, you might even start to enjoy the process.  Good luck my friend.

"The social dynamic changes after High school, usually for the better. People are generally more mature, and chiller. It’s harder to find a social group in some aspects, so everyone feels like a small fish in a big pond. I’m not going to lie to you and say bullying doesnt exist outside of school, but generally it’s easier to protect yourself as an adult than it was.   People generally react well to people who are friendly and kind. They also like to feel helpful, so a good icebreaker is to ask someone for a pen or to explain a topic. People might be forming study groups, and this could be a good way to make friends and learn.   If someone purposefully bumps into you, that’s weird behaviour. You also don’t need to react in any particular way. If they keep doing it then you can call them out on it, or move your shoulder before they can barge it.   Try asserting smaller boundaries first, like asking for a coffee with a weird addition, or saying excuse me instead of walking the long way round. Build it up until you can assert bigger boundaries with people.   People aren’t allowed to push you about! Maybe see if there’s any martial arts clubs at your college, and if they offer classes. If you know how to carry yourself in a physical confrontation, you might feel more confident to stand up for yourself in a non violent way!

"I definitely think therapy is important with ED’s. But for underage people it can be a bit traumatising, as they are usually coerced/non-voluntary, so that makes it a bit difficult. As someone else commented, an ED specialised dietitian is good to be involved. But I would especially recommend psychotherapy!!   Having an ED is something all consuming. It’s like the ED takes over in your brain and tries to control everything in your life. So when in recovery it most likely will become a constant battle for every decision, to listen to what the ED wants or to consciously choose for recovery. This is where the psychotherapy comes in, because having the knowledge of how ED’s work can be helpful in finding the strength to make the right choices.  As for the parenting side of it, I honestly don’t know what to advise. Having an ED is something very personal and most people want to keep it for themselves. Also not having an ED (as the parent) will make it very hard to understand what’s going on in their mind. Every comment you make about eating, her body, exercising, whatever, could be a trigger or it can be misinterpreted or get twisted by the ED.  Speaking from my personal experience; when i’m in recovery I definitely appreciate all the help I can get from my mom. But when i’m having a relapse, I get very secretive and I get anxious/annoyed when my mom tries to help.  Also note that people with ED’s tend to become very good liars. I’m definitely not saying that this is the case with your daughter, just something to keep in mind. When things seem to be going well, you have nice family dinners or you see her snacking, you don’t know if she’s like actively compensating. e.g. purging, excessive exercising, taking laxatives or diuretics.  sorry for the long story. In conclusion:  Definitely recommend professional help. As for the parenting I personally don’t believe there is much you can do, try communicating as openly as possible and within her comfort levels. Also maybe watching a documentary or reading a book written by someone with an ED about their personal experience, to maybe help you understand a bit better.",EatingDisorders,positive,definitely think therapy important ed ’ s underage people bit traumatising usually coercednonvoluntary make bit difficult someone else commented ed specialised dietitian good involved would especially recommend psychotherapy ed something consuming it ’ s like ed take brain try control everything life recovery likely become constant battle every decision listen ed want consciously choose recovery psychotherapy come knowledge ed ’ s work helpful finding strength make right choice parenting side honestly don ’ t know advise ed something personal people want keep also ed parent make hard understand what ’ s going mind every comment make eating body exercising whatever could trigger misinterpreted get twisted ed speaking personal experience i ’ m recovery definitely appreciate help get mom i ’ m relapse get secretive get anxiousannoyed mom try help also note people ed ’ s tend become good liar i ’ m definitely saying case daughter something keep mind thing seem going well nice family dinner see snacking don ’ t know she ’ s like actively compensating eg purging excessive exercising taking laxative diuretic sorry long story conclusion definitely recommend professional help parenting personally don ’ t believe much try communicating openly possible within comfort level also maybe watching documentary reading book written someone ed personal experience maybe help understand bit better,SUBJECTIVE
Maybe CBT therapy for social anxiety will be helpful for you! You seem to have some cognitive distortions such as overgeneralization because you seem to be certain that you will embarass yourself in every social interaction. Along with that you are thinking that you would be unable to cope with the embarassment should it happen. The reality is that you probably won't be embarassed in most of your social interactions and even if you did get embarassed you would still live and it wouldnt be the end of the world.

"My story starts off when I was in year 8 (12-13), you’re going to need a bit of backstory though.   So when I was in year 8 I had made a new group of friends when I was in the library at school one day and we always used to chill and stuff after school and it used to be so fun. Our meeting place was at a church on a street just off a main road, it had a shop and a mosque directly across from it. Sometimes we would just stay at the church and chill and it was all great.   On a totally unrelated day I was sat in my room and I thought that I hadn’t checked my insta dms in a while so I checked them, everything was normal until I saw a concerning message off a blank profile, I clicked on it and all I saw was pictures of me at this church, me in my school uniform walking home, me waiting outside my friends house it was so scary.   I’m freaking out trying to figure out who this is, I was thinking ‘what middle aged man is stalking me?’ And so the next day at school I tell my friends about it. They were in these photos so they were obviously concerned and we tried our hardest to find out who he was but he was untraceable, I felt so lost and so paranoid it was insane.   So about a week later I’m sat in the library and I was telling my other friend about it and she goes ‘let me see the account’ I show her and her mouth drops. She goes ‘omg I know him’ and I’m like ‘huh?’ She goes ‘yeah he’s in my maths class’ so after hearing that I just thought it was a prank or something. She then shows me a picture of the guy and i recognised him, he worked in a chicken shop that me and my friend had gone to and we spoke to each other but it was only friendly conversation.   Another major thing about this story is that this guy was in year 11 (16) so it was wild to me. Long story short my friends pressured him and he confessed and told me everything. He said when he saw me for the first time he thought nothing of it but he started seeing me at the church after school and he said he liked me. When I was at this church he would look out the windows in the mosque and see me there so he thought he’d try and dm me but I never answered, my notifications were off!

"So I had a really similar situation, where my best friend/ roommate heard me purging and asked if I was okay.

"I never sought out a diagnosis for it, but I got bonus diagnosed for it when I went in for an ADHD evaluation/assessment! Got diagnosed with both ADHD and social anxiety, variety is the spice of life and all that ig.  For you, I'd recommend looking into mental health services near you that offer official evaluations and diagnoses - I reached out to my university for local recommendations since I'm from out-of-state, and they sent me a few. I had to talk with a psychiatrist from one near me and explain why I thought I might have ADHD/why I was reaching out, then I had a couple hours with a psychometrist and did some evaluations (also for ADHD), then I filled in a kind of survey thing asking about my 'emotional functioning' (PHQ-9 and BAI) and checked a bunch of options that were indicative of social anxiety in addition to my ADHD (which evaluations also indicated I had). Paid after the fact, got sent an itemized bill and had to file claims on my insurance for partial reimbursement but it was really straightforward.   Not too long after my appointment with psychometrist (1-2 weeks), I met with the psychiatrist again and she sent me a PDF document with info, going through it she explained my diagnoses, what led her to diagnose me, etc., with my test results and explanations, plus a text explanation at the end explaining useful resources for me and what could probably be useful accommodations for me as a student - that part might be especially helpful if you want accommodations, although mine were more centered around my ADHD. The survey about my emotional functioning was the part more relevant to my social anxiety diagnosis, along with what I had said when I first met with the psychiatrist and we talked about my past experiences both in and out of school, struggles I've had, etc - I didn't explicitly say I have social anxiety, but the experiences I shared were apparently very indicative of it.  Not all of that will be the most relevant for just the social anxiety aspect, but I thought I'd share a more overarching summary of my experience so you have a better idea of how it worked for me!

"I’m sorry to hear that, and as upsetting as it is right now, allow yourself to feel your emotions but please don’t give up.  People with severe depression often hang their worth and purpose onto the expectation timeline that ‘normal’ people follow in terms of life’s milestones- things like graduating, getting a job, getting married, having kids, buying a house, retiring, etc.  Here’s a golden bit of wisdom from my therapist: As hard as it is to get out of the habit, depression and mental health are considered disabilities. People with disabilities aren’t expected to be able to perform at the same level, they face more challenges just to ‘show up’, and I often need to remind myself of that too, so I hope you’ll take on this perspective as well just to be a little kinder to yourself.  I dropped out of university in my second year due to depression, I left my placement at 8 months because of depression and anxiety, everyone else I went to college with seemed like they knew what they wanted to with their life and were chasing their life goals and making plans but I never knew what I wanted to do. Each birthday that passed, I wasn’t happy, I just said ‘well… didn’t expect to be here this long’.  But you know what? After a nearly two year break, I tried again. I’ve now graduated last year and started my Masters’ degree this year, looking to start a placement in the summer too. Depression doesn’t go away, I still struggle, but as long as you keep fighting, you’ll have success stories to be proud of yourself for. No matter how small the victories seem.  I believe in you. If you need a break but being stagnant is something scary to you like it was to me, consider looking for opportunities that seem manageable to you. If you haven’t gotten your driving license for example, start studying for your theory/written test.   More than anything, I encourage you to reach out to your personal tutor at university or the wellbeing/mental health team, these kinds of things are free and you can get confidential help from a counsellor to access services that can get you back on track. You can also get leaves of absence and additional support like extended deadlines if it’s necessary.

"Hello,I am 47M, and I have paranoid schizophrenia since the turn of the century. Although I will probably have to take meds for the rest of my life, I consider myself recovered. I was in denial from the moment I received my diagnosis around 1999-2000 until 2008. Because of my condition, I was mistrustful, especially towards my psychiatrist. In 2009, I saw a documentary about cannabis and schizophrenia in which people like me were giving their testimony and this was part of the solution for the beginning of my recovery. Apart from testimonies, I understand that some factors that helped me get back on my feet were:  \- Admitting and understanding that I really have this disease;  \- My appreciation of health and discipline (respecting treatments and professionals, and staying away from triggers);  \- Having loving parents who supported me to a reasonable extent;  \- Have a psychiatrist I can trust to help me;  \- Live in an area that offers affordable health care (including effective medications);  \- My wish to live a healthy life and be able to support myself;  \- My respect for the law;  \- My will to do good.

"Hello, (25 f) I’ve been diagnosis with anorexia purge subtype since I was 15 and it developed when I was even younger age 11. I didn’t actually get treatment until I was 15 years old at an eating disorder treatment facility. Eating disorders require a specific treatment as it is a speciality in the field. The current evidence based treatment for ALL eating disorder diagnosis is a team of psychiatrist (for medication management), intuitive eating dietician (helps debunk diet-culture myths and food labeling and food rules and helps to view nutrition from a more nuetral and INTUITIVE lens and we were all born intuitive eaters with the ability to both TRUST and connect and listen to body. Disordered eating breeds the opposite: body distrust, fear, and disconnection. They help explore relationship with food and barriers to eating which usually is rooted in fear and cognitive distortions) and then of course a therapist that specializes in eating disorders as it is a specialty.   It sounds like your son already has an extensive history with mental health and mental health is complex and often these things DO overlap. I just want to say that from an outsider view—you have done so much already and are a great father and support. It really shows you care for your son.   Obviously you have to get evaluated and diagnosed by a professional to confirm but it sounds like your son could be struggling with ORTHOREXIA: Orthorexia is an unhealthy focus on eating in a healthy way. Eating nutritious food is good, but if you have orthorexia, you obsess about it to a degree that can damage your overall well-being.  Orthorexia Symptoms  If you have orthorexia, you might:  Worry about food quality. High levels of concern about the quality and source of foods you eat could lead to anxiety. Avoid going out to eat or avoid eating food prepared by others out of fear that foods you don’t prepare yourself won’t meet your standards. Fear sickness. You worry about how “clean” food is or if it’s “bad” for your health. Show physical signs of malnutrition. When you limit the variety of foods you eat, you may not get all the nourishment you need. You could lose weight as a result. Bury yourself in food research. It’s one thing to spend a few minutes scanning a product label or surfing the web for more information on ingredients. But with orthorexia, you may spend hours thinking about food and planning meals. Refuse to eat a broad range of foods. It’s normal to avoid some foods because you don’t like the way they taste or the way they make you feel. But with orthorexia, you might decide to drop whole categories of foods from your diet. For example, you might stop eating grains; or any foods with preservatives, gluten, or sugar; or all foods that just don’t seem “healthy."" Fear losing control. You feel that you’re doing the right thing by eating healthy. But you may also be afraid that eating even one meal you didn’t prepare -- including dinner at a restaurant -- can be disastrous. Be overly critical of your friends’ food choices. At the same time, you may have no rational explanation for your own. Find yourself in a vicious circle. Your preoccupation with food causes you to bounce between self-love and guilt as you change and restrict your diet.  Development:  Biological: Having a close relative with an eating disorder, a history of dieting, or type I diabetes  Psychological: Perfectionism, dissatisfaction with your body, or a history of anxiety  Social/cultural: Being teased or bullied about your weight, having had family trauma that spans generations (as Holocaust survivors do), or buying into the idea of an “ideal” body  The freshmen “15” is a diet-culture myth BTW so I wouldn’t reinforce that nonsense that isn’t even rooted in reality.   Him labeling food as “clean” is rooted in the diet-culture practice of associating MORALITY with food and it’s referred to as food labeling. So labeling foods as “good” vs “bad” “clean” “pure” “dirty” “JUNK” “unhealthy” vs “healthy” —polarizing food and also utilizing the black and white thinking cognitive distortion surrounding food. Food labeling is rooted in diet-culture and is disordered and also is a literal eating disorder behavior. If diet-culture didn’t exist, eating disorders wouldn’t exist in many ways the disordered cognitions and behaviors stem and are learned behaviors from diet-culture.  College is a prime time for the development for eating disorders in general. This is because 1. Diet-culture is HELLA prominent in college campuses. And 2. Because college is a massive LIFE CHANGE and eating disorders are COPING MECHANISMS at their core not even about food or bodies. Food and bodies is the DISTRACTION to mask and cope with underlying issues such as trauma.   There are a lot of overlapping in eating disorder and other mental illness. MOST sufferers will have some other co-occurring mood disorder paired with the ED such as depression and anxiety and also OCD is very common.   I highly recommend seeking professional help and support from eating disorder specialists. In the mean time you can help support him with food by avoiding food labeling yourself if it’s a common practice in the house and redirect him when he demonizes food and attaches morality to it and labels food. Just point it out maybe when he says something like “I’m not eating x food it’s GARBAGE!!” You could be like, “Food isn’t garbage, garbage is garbage! 🗑️ or point to actual garbage to show him how distorted that truly is.   He certainly shows food fear and food labeling. Redirect food labeling and encourage eating opportunities. Don’t enable him by only buying the foods he deems as “safe foods” forever. Maybe in beginning a little bit of enabling is fine as ANYTHING is better than nothing. In treatment though they will be trying to work with him on challenging these behaviors and he will need to explore with variety and face his food fears is recovery eventually.

"I get it, and I don't know what it was, but something clicked. It is not just abut being enthusiastic and talkative, because that is really hard, but it is about not worrying about what others think of you. People are intimidating, and if you view everyone as equal to you, and you equal to everyone else, you will realize that it does not matter what people think of you. That's what it took for me to get rid of my anxiety. There are times where it is tough to get myself out there, but most of the time, I just think that it is not worth sulking around because I think someone could have a better conversation with another person, I get up and talk. It is better to say something than sit around and not say anything, even if what you say is awkward. The only way to be more talkative and get better social skills is to talk, so you will need those awkward conversations. There is no way to bypass that. Try going on elevators and making ""small talk"" with people in them. If it is awkward, then learn from that mistake. If it is good, then note that and make similar conversations with other people. Just don't let depression get to you like it did with me back in the day, and don't let others think they're better than you, because they are not, they are just arrogant and immature. Just give it time, the right opportunities will eventually show up at the right times.",socialanxiety,positive,get dont know something clicked abut enthusiastic talkative really hard worrying others think people intimidating view everyone equal equal everyone else realize matter people think thats took get rid anxiety time tough get time think worth sulking around think someone could better conversation another person get talk better say something sit around say anything even say awkward way talkative get better social skill talk need awkward conversation way bypass try going elevator making small talk people awkward learn mistake good note make similar conversation people dont let depression get like back day dont let others think theyre better arrogant immature give time right opportunity eventually show right time,SUBJECTIVE

"I can hard relate to this.   I'm also a Nurse (adult), got my first jobs in critical care once i got my Pin stayed for 3 years, i realised how much stuff i had to deal with and started therapy, medications while still working and looking after my nana. After she passed i only lasted a year there, it was too hard to see people at their worst after accidents, suicide attempts, cancer surgery all of it. Towards the end i noticed there was more going on than anxiety and depression and spriraled so hard. I left hospital nursing because i wasn't safe took 6 months off because i couldn't work and was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.   Once i figured out how to manage this i went to do vaccines seasonally for a few years which was actually a nice little job and got me the hours i needed to keep my registration. Doing other odd jobs here or there in between the winter seasons.   Went back to hospital Nursing during the pandemic because i needed to feel useful again and seasonal work wasn't really enough anymore. This bought a whole layer of different trauma but i actually coped well with this tbh with the support of a good therapist. Last year i got offically diagnosed with PTSD (unrepresssd CSA memories came up) which i have told work about (diagnosis only not the reason) and i am given time/space to go to a quiet room when needed even if that is just my managers office.   I have adjustments for attending therapy sessions every thursday, i have that day off. I don't work nights either due to the bipolar and its medications this was put in by occupational health.

"I started showing signs of an ED at 11. Most likely, she is stressed/dealing with some form of anxiety or depression, and struggling with changing hormones/body that can feel super overwhelming. She needs support and curiosity related to any underlying emotional issues/life struggles, as well as alternative, positive outlets/coping mechanisms.   As far as triggers/struggles, the following comes to mind as possible.  If shes recently changed schools/friends/been rejected/done poorly in school, that could be a trigger. Sports and competition can be triggering environments as well where body types are scrutinized and compared in a way that young people can internalize.  There might be something she's experienced that you don't know about. Be curious and unconditionally supportive, but be attentive. I dont want to sound scary, but alot of SA victims struggle with eating disorders as a coping mechanism. Not saying this is it at all, just emphasizing the importance of asking questions and being curious about her life and the people in it.  Lead by example when it comes to food. Dont model any kind of restriction or mentioning foods as good/bad. Make sure she is eating her lunch at school.

"They (some?) build up in your system over time, some meds work faster than others, some slower. Some don't work at all or at least not very well. When you go off the meds, you still have them in your system. Took 6 months for Clozapine to leave my system. And I'm not even fighting you on this point: even the Clozapine didn't do crap for the voices in my head until I got Latuda in there and that wasn't until I was off Clozapine; but for that 6 months it was like: No voices, are you kidding me? I went home and wasn't bothered by voices EVER. Off it now due to emergency complications.  But yeah, I mean it's kinda like a nicotine patch, you put one on it just sits there and only after 8 hours or so can you get that steady stream of nicotine at it's full potential then after 24 hours you replace it with a new one. Clozapine builds up over about 3-4 months I think it was before it fully works at an effective level. But you take it every day. Some like me would require an additional pill like Latuda to get the rest of the way.  So it's not always a kick-in you're looking for. I mean Seroquel can induce drowsiness within a short span but I assume any anti-psychotic depends on it being taken. It's not a fast acting med for ""schizophrenia flare-ups."" Not even my COPD inhaler works that way. That said, a day or two missed of your meds I don't think is always bad and I hate the controlling nature behind ""Be sure to take them every day and at the same time."" I miss meds occasionally it's bound to happen. If I miss twice in a week I'm probably going to be a more relaxed guy less likely to argue with you I don't know why but it's true.  Psychiatrists don't seem to like the fact that when I'm doing well I'm a more difficult person to coerce or control into compliance so they feed me certain meds based on that end so that I don't feel my best. I'm convinced of this much.  Yes, you should have every right to go off your meds and if you're doing fine great!

"28 F it's been hard. I changed to ""actions of love"" instead of ""words of love"" and at least for me it's been working. Smaller changes were for example I used to wear discount clothes even if they were not to my liking. My closet is smaller than before, but everything owned is something I like. I was a very cheap person, I had to change that mindset and view myself as an investment.   The biggest change was removing people from my life and being comfortable with my own company. In the last two years, I've distanced myself from 85% of the people I used to hang out with. The shift in my life was noticeable. Due to my low self-esteem, I used to surround myself with people who were aware of this and took advantage of the situation. I had to work to stop being a people pleaser and not to care about other's opinions.  We tend to be kinder with others than ourselves so I started to view myself as a little sister. What would I tell her if she were in my shoes? and started acting upon that. Also, I started to trust my gut. I used to ignore my instincts believing it was due to anxiety. I'm still learning to differentiate between anxiety and instincts as it gets a bit confusing sometimes, but if I ever get a strong feeling I listen to it.   And I started to question my opinions. Are they mine, or what's socially acceptable? I've ditched TikTok and only consume video content of people who share the same values as me.   These are the changes I made. At 25 I was still in a dark place but I feel better now and confident that I won't go back to bad habits. Life just feels different.

"First of all, I'm really sorry for all your hardships!     You're sharing wants and dreams that every person already had, at one point or another, so I don't think there's any shame in that. The problems start when we cannot see past the existence of perfection, of an idealized version of what reality is.  I also suffer from ADHD (taking Concerta) with my issue always being that I would crumble whenever I couldn't perform how I envisioned that I should. I used to be a straight A student until I started spiraling down with depression near the end of my High School. I was able to enroll into a nice Institute (portuguese higher education system), which I ended up dropping out off some time later.  I had a really hard time with not being ""good enough"", when I used to be a perfect student, good in academics and sports (I actually blundered an opportunity at being a pro futsal player when I was young). Being a dropout and letting myself go physically was a major toll on my vision of perfect, the perfect self I could never hope to achieve now.  With the passage of time (I'm a 30 M for context), I ended up learning that to strive towards my very best self, and my very best life financially, I need to accept my mistakes and flaws, and build upon them. There's always gonna be anxiety, bad performances, anger, or just straight bad luck, but the way you view all of that, can change it from an insurmountable wall, to a hard, but possible to beat, obstacle course, that will have worthy rewards at the end.  Once again, I'm really sorry that you had to go through some very awful situations, but I believe you can achieve what you want to achieve if you ""just"" (I know how hard it is to do) work on how you view yourself in relation to the world. Allow yourself more leeway and allow yourself to fail, you can only pass through obstacles if you try again after failing.  There's a saying in portuguese that goes like this: ""Parar é morrer"", literally it means ""Stopping is dying"". That is to say, you can only live if you actually move through life, otherwise you are just alive, you are not living.",depression,positive,first im really sorry hardship youre sharing want dream every person already one point another dont think there shame problem start can not see past existence perfection idealized version reality also suffer adhd taking concerta issue always would crumble whenever couldnt perform envisioned used straight student started spiraling depression near end high school able enroll nice institute portuguese higher education system ended dropping time later really hard time good enough used perfect student good academic sport actually blundered opportunity pro futsal player young dropout letting go physically major toll vision perfect perfect self could never hope achieve passage time im 30 context ended learning strive towards best self best life financially need accept mistake flaw build upon there always gon na anxiety bad performance anger straight bad luck way view change insurmountable wall hard possible beat obstacle course worthy reward end im really sorry go awful situation believe achieve want achieve know hard work view relation world allow leeway allow fail pas obstacle try failing there saying portuguese go like parar é morrer literally mean stopping dying say live actually move life otherwise alive living,SUBJECTIVE

"Therapy is... not really effective, if at all.

"Hello. I can really feel for you, I was like that during my first episode and during another major episode I had after one of my high school classmates died (this was intersected with a major depressive episode). However, there's nothing I can really do for you, I can only tell you what I did, though it was not perfect. I don't know how severe your episode is, but what I did was I started cleaning the whole house. I would do everything just so the time would pass by quicker, and it's better to do something tangible and productive because you'll feel at least a little better. Don't worry about being a burden, I understand it's impossible to not feel like that at points, but once you're better, you won't feel like that. It will pass. Just do everything so that you survive to see your psychiatrist, you're almost there! Just one day, though I imagine the fact it's only one day is the most heart-breaking part of it. It's so close yet so far, but don't worry, it will get better. There will probably be a change of meds, and after that it will all be about patience. These things pass, and they pass quicker if you're on medication. Realize that untreated psychosis can last months, but with medication it goes by so much quicker. Either way, I'm sorry I can't help you more, that's sadly for your psychiatrist to do. Maybe someone else will have a clever idea I did not think of (and I hope they do), but this will mostly be a waiting game. Try to power through, even if it seems impossible, because remember - it will all pass, and one day you will be so much better.",schizophrenia,positive,hello really feel like first episode another major episode one high school classmate died intersected major depressive episode however there nothing really tell though perfect dont know severe episode started cleaning whole house would everything time would pas quicker better something tangible productive youll feel least little better dont worry burden understand impossible feel like point youre better wont feel like pas everything survive see psychiatrist youre almost one day though imagine fact one day heartbreaking part close yet far dont worry get better probably change med patience thing pas pas quicker youre medication realize untreated psychosis last month medication go much quicker either way im sorry cant help thats sadly psychiatrist maybe someone else clever idea think hope mostly waiting game try power even seems impossible remember pas one day much better,SUBJECTIVE

"I’m diagnosed with CPTSD with psychosis so not schizophrenia officially but the same kind of symptoms.  Keeping my stress levels low is very important for me, if I get overloaded with stress I get a psychotic episode, also i have them often depending on the time of year. I usually have at least 2 / 3 episodes of psychosis per year but my last episode was over 3 months long and I was detained in hospital and had forced injections. They brought me back to reality gradually (aripiprazole and abilify maintena). I still feel like I’m being monitored and observed in my own home, even more so outside of my home, but I don’t see medication fixing that as I’ve had the “delusion” for over 10 years now.  My voices are pretty much gone right now. I was experiencing auditory hallucinations, visual, tactile, and olfactory during my last episode. I found art therapy helpful while I was in hospital. It helped me express my reality at that point in time. My therapist said I can probably make recovery with the proper trauma therapy but I’m not so sure as I have hallucinations pre dating my trauma.  Either way as long as I keep my stress levels low I seem to cope okay. But as we all know life is unpredictable and I know I have to get back to trying to improve my life soon which I know isn’t going to go well. I have multiple mental illnesses and physical disabilities so I can’t decide if I should just give up on it and accept that I’m too disabled to ever work properly and be able to get married or live with someone I love, or if I should try to just manage my conditions as much as I can and be on disability for the rest of my life. It’s hard. In my country (UK) if I live with someone considered my significant other then I lose entitlement to benefits so would be financially dependent on another person so I have to live alone for now because of that. I’m hoping, maybe in vain, that I can one day have disability AND live with someone I am in a relationship with, because it makes me feel like even more of a weirdo to not be able to have these normal adult things in my life. Living with a partner helps my mental health a lot. Which is why I was trying to improve my career prospects and study but it sent me off into psychosis.

"I don’t have any advice as to how to shut off that part of your brain because frankly that’s quite impossible.   However what I’m doing, and I think *could* have the potential to work, is that even if I do check the calories and add the up in my head, I don’t let it *affect* my food choices. It’s merely acknowledging, and then ignoring.  Ate x calories more at dinner? Okay but imma still eat my usual night snack (and more if I need to). A yogurt in the store is higher cal than the other yogurt? Imma buy the higher cal one still because I want it more now.  I believe that once you’ve taught your brain that this information doesn’t have any power over your food choices, you’ll slowly realize checking/counting calories is pointless and merely a waste of time.

"One of my favorite books is called Man’s Search for Meaning. It’s about A Jewish Psychiatrist in a concentration camp during the Holocaust. He observed who survived and who died.

"I would definitely recommend to start journaling. Journal everything!! Thoughts, frustrations, goals, eating goals, what you want for dinner, what emotions you’re feeling, the emotions you experience while binging. Literally everything that you feel or think- write it down. Doesn’t matter how little or big the thought is.   Have a meal planned for when you’re done with work. It sounds like you are hungry post work and that’s okay! Even something as simple as scrambled eggs and a waffle/toast are filling and satisfying. Protein is a must for feeling full and satiated, drink lots of water! Before you grab a snack, drink a glass of water. You could be mistaking thirst as hunger, this is very common.   Some snack combos I would recommend; mozzarella and pepperoni, apple and pb, eggs and toast, trail mix  Hope this helps! Always remember, memories>food.

"Hey there. Sounds like you are dealing with a lot right now.  As much as you think this moment is the end of the world. I want to reassure you, it's not.  You said. ""i dont know what to do, she was my drive my boat i sailed so i can prosper and get where i want to be""  First, you may not have the tools, resources, or know how right now, but they exist.  That's why you are encountering this to lead you to them. To get you to realize they have always been there. To make you more self-aware.  You've got the cart before the horse, my friend and think life is trying to take something away. No, life is trying to add but to do so, it must make room.  If that girl wants to leave, it's because her journey is taking her elsewhere. You have learned all that you need to from her and now you must continue on as she must.  You are thinking someone outside of you is the engine, the wind in your sail, the reason why you can prosper and get to where you want to be.  Yet, clearly life is saying, no, you have misunderstood and have become reliant on those I have brought into your life.  This is just another pitstop on the rest of your journey, a journey that will likely lead you to as many good times that you have had in the past.  However, you are suffering because you are trying to hold on to the past.  If something no longer serves your journey it will vanish, it will collapse, it will fail.  You can wallow and cry or see it for it is, revealing the next thing that is meant for you.  Here's the thing, life has a way of showing up and guiding us along the stream of life by making us bump into rocks to keep us on track. It's uncomfortable. Sometimes it can feel we are bumping up against multiple rocks but each time, you bounce away into a new direction.  Once we stop trying to cling to a specific rock that wasn't meant for us and just surrender. By surrender i mean see life what it is, a series of red lights ( stopping ), amber ( waiting), green (go) we can realizing life isn't working against us but for us.Unfortunately we want to go when we have to wait, or move on when it says stop. That creates internal frustration. However, if you could see up ahead what pitfalls you have avoided by having to wait or stop. If you could see what forced you to move forward, back, left or right, and the crash you would have experienced had you moved when you were meant to stop, you would appreciate the process more. You can't see ahead, but you can realize it is a series of stops and starts, and changes in direction.I'll end on this.  Have you heard the story of a Chinese farmer?  Here it is...*A farmer and his son had a beloved horse who helped the family earn a living. One day, the horse ran away and their neighbours exclaimed, “Your horse ran away, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”A few days later, the horse returned home, leading a few wild horses back to the farm as well. The neighbours shouted out, “Your horse has returned, and brought several horses home with him. What great luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”Later that week, the farmer’s son was trying to break one of the horses and she threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. The neighbours cried, “Your son broke his leg, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”A few weeks later, soldiers from the national army marched through town, recruiting all boys for the army. They did not take the farmer’s son, because he had a broken leg. The neighbours shouted, “Your boy is spared, what tremendous luck!” To which the farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”*  It is really impossible to tell whether anything that happens is good or bad.

"I've found traditional psychoanalysis to be somewhat hostile to psychosis. Especially in Lacanian analysis there are certain ideas that render the treatment of psychosis impossible: lack of an unconscious, inability to produce meaningful narrative, lack of repression, etc. old, outdated ideas about psychotic mental processes seem to lead analysts to consider psychotic patients incurable.   And yet, we have identities, lived experiences, and traumas that require narratization and reflection. New ideas and methods of analysis are needed (perhaps focusing on creative production rather than direct analysis of the delusion?) to make psychoanalysis meaningful for psychosis experiencers. How can therapy strengthen the idea of the self and put delusional narratives into a meaningful context relative to the world? How can therapy reestablish a self / world relationship? Some kind of analysis can do this, but it's rare, and perhaps under theorized.",schizophrenia,positive,ive found traditional psychoanalysis somewhat hostile psychosis especially lacanian analysis certain idea render treatment psychosis impossible lack unconscious inability produce meaningful narrative lack repression etc old outdated idea psychotic mental process seem lead analyst consider psychotic patient incurable yet identity lived experience trauma require narratization reflection new idea method analysis needed perhaps focusing creative production rather direct analysis delusion make psychoanalysis meaningful psychosis experiencers therapy strengthen idea self put delusional narrative meaningful context relative world therapy reestablish self world relationship kind analysis rare perhaps theorized,SUBJECTIVE

"Yes it’s an eoedemic the age for early body dissatisfaction has gotten lower. Studies are showing children as young as 6 years old are now actively showing body dissatisfaction and body dysmorphia signs. I developed my ED at age 11. 25 f fully recovered now but wouldn’t consider myself truly recovered until this year. A decade of on and off recovery and treatment and many relapses recovery truly isn’t linear. First and foremost it’s not your fault, it’s a coping mechanism. How we talk about food and diet culture are known to fuel and exasperate the illness though. I know a lot of my ED behaviors truly were passed down learned behaviors from family due to diet-culture. I don’t know the house of dynamics with food and what you have taught your children in regards to food but I know food labeling and calling food junk is normalized but disordered and fueled my illness. Be careful how you talk about food and the messages you could be sending about food and bodies. Seek professional help. Don’t force or pressure to eat but rather encourage and promote eating opportunities for your daughter. The evidence based treatment for EDs right now is a team of trauma informed therapist and intuitive eating dietician. I didn’t get help till I was 15 and went to my first program as a minor. It’s a coping mechanism. It’s serving a purpose for her. For me it started around puberty which is already a difficult time and then culture shock and being bullied for my weight and mom that was diet culture obsessed and pediatrician that pointed out my BMI and told me to lose weight at age 11 all contributed to the development of my ED. I also found out I had ADHD and a lot of my ED struggles were also sensory issues related as well as cognitive distortions and coping mechanism. Truly a multifaceted issue. Mental health is complex. Early intervention is key. I’d recommend getting her help asap and talk to doctor for referrals for a good ED program if necessary. Treatment saved my life on many occasions. It’s a deadly disease. Eating disorders used to be number one for years now second highest mortality rate of any MENTAL ILLNESS following opioid abuse.   She is trying to cope and survive the best way she knows how right now and it happens to be a maladaptive coping mechanism. Social media can be very dangerous for minors nowadays days especially with the pro Ana content and normalized disorder eating content in general. I fear to have kids due to this.

"Everything will be okay.  I'm in a similar situation where I have to start over in a career that I don't hate, and it is definitely daunting.  However, it's always going to be better late than never, no matter how old you feel.  In the end, you still have decades of work ahead of you, so looking at it through that lens makes it a little more bearable.  Enjoying, or at least caring, about your work is very important to your happiness.  Instead of looking at life as failing or winning, consider looking at it like you're going through a journey, and the outcome is less important.  Making these big changes will certainly be eventful, and isn't that what makes life interesting?  Struggling is a part of life, and it will usually eventually be fruitful, as long as your goal is aligned with your passion and core values.   That said, of course there are real-life consequences too.  For practical advice, try not to push your limit in terms of work and school.  It will be challenging, but don't make things impossible for yourself.  You may need to get a job that is easier, less hours, or more entry-level to start with.  It's easier to get a job while you have a job, so don't think of your next job as where you'll spend the rest of your life, view it as a stepping stone.  Don't stop looking for better jobs, move around as needed, and try to get into your ideal field, even if it's in a low position.  That way, you build experience in the field, and potentially can move up the chain in the same company.  You're going to be okay, as long as you keep trying.  Don't give up, and please don't ever hurt yourself.

"Honestly for me it’s just practice. Most interviews consist of the most common interview questions so look them up, watch videos on how to answer those questions well and then practice your answer for them over and over again. For me that helps eliminate nerves as even if my mind goes blank for a second and I can regain my composure as it’s easier to remember an answer to something you’ve rehearsed so many times.    I also use propranolol for the physical anxiety symptoms I experience so I’m more able to focus on what I’m being asked as well as being able to focus on my answer. I also recommended not worrying about coming across as nervous everyone is they expect you to be nervous but what makes a good interview is you being able to answer questions well despite dealing with nerves. I just had an interview recently where I stated straight up that I was nervous but I still got the job because I still had a good interview despite that because I practiced beforehand. Also getting experience interviewing helps whether it be mock interviews or you literally going to interviews maybe without even the intention of wanting the job but to just get some experience so you feel more comfortable so then when there is a job you want you’ll feel more comfortable and be more successful.

"Some of your descriptions hit very hard. You aren't alone.    Are you an alcoholic? Or is alcohol & people/places where alcohol is prevalent the trigger for you?    *""I don't feel that I'm worth being friends with.""*  That is very common in depression, PTSD, and addiction.  We sufferers are better actors than anyone with an Oscar. We know what's ""right"", ""what's expected"" so we pull ""that mask"" on for whatever occasion we have to rise to.    And like you describe, we do it until we are too exhausted to keep it up. Even the day to day is a HUGE effort. Eating, showering, house cleaning...I swear, if I didn't have animals that depend on me, I'd never do anything. Lawd help my husband if he suggests one more time that pajamas aren't necessarily ""day wear'. 😳   It can get better. Sounds like you are taking steps in that direction.    ""Listening"" to what you said, here are my thoughts, trying to help & hear you.    It almost seems like you/your therapist are ""combining"" the disorders & they really are different. Yes, you can absolutely have multiple at one time but I feel it's important  to separate some of the symptoms from each other.    For instance, when you say you are missing large swaths of time...PTSD causes blackouts, but those blackouts are usually replaced with a PTSD trauma recurrence. So you know it's missing time from present, but you were living in the trauma.    An episode due to depression, I describe it as ""drowning"". You know you are with friends, you may remember it's an occasion/holiday, remember bits & pieces of the occasion (in the water), but you only recall the conversations in snippets, or that you were suddenly looking in their eyes as they spoke but you dont remember much else. Did they ask a question, do you need to say/do something? (This is under the water), then you try to ask a question, take a drink, make a toast, make a joke to attempt control or cover your lapse (bursting to the surface) ...for it to start over.    It sounds like you have experienced *(what I call)* the half in/half out episode. You went when you really didn't want to. You tried hard to have fun & meaningful participation, you laughed, joked....but you forced yourself to do so. That means you remember more about how hard you tried to be present but you don't remember the event.  You dont have the fondness, sentimentality or happiness.  You feel like your friends/family are better friends to you, than you are to them. Now guilt is included in what you do remember.    I say all that to see if we are in fact on the same page.     I think you could benefit from the help of another professional.  I'm a little concerned that outwardly, you're so good at ""the mask"" that your current professional missed episodes.     Now someone here is going to question this, so let me try to explain. In depression, PTSD, & addiction you have the side of you that you present to the public & even close friends/family.    PTSD & addiction disorders have depression as a symptom combined with all their other defining characteristics. But with depression on its own, it's depression unrelated to PTSD or disorders related to addiction.    I'm not explaining it very well, but depression being THE ""big picture"" has it's own origins, it's own symptoms/issues. Depression as A symptom to PTSD is related to your trauma(s) & depression as a symptom to an addiction is based solely on the addiction behavior.  It's still depression but has a different impact.    The panic attacks - are you able to recognize them as they come on or are they ""Bam"" I'm  there?    I use counting when I'm out in public...it's what I can control & it's not overt. I also recite songs in my head. It's weird, but you don't always remember what you know in an episode. For me, the childhood song ""Jesus Loves Me"" is one I remember when I can't even remember my name.  Just a suggestion.    My ex was a hard core alcoholic. To quit, he replaced every drink with physical activity. I do that when I'm in a PTSD episode. Even if it's  push ups against a wall or walk/run up stairs.    It's hard to feel ""energized"" to do anything, but for me, hopefully it helps you, the fear of going back to those traumas, letting those images in, the smells...I break it up by literally running away, singing my song.    I hope something helps...but you aren't alone.",ptsd,positive,description hit hard arent alone alcoholic alcohol peopleplaces alcohol prevalent trigger dont feel im worth friend common depression ptsd addiction sufferer better actor anyone oscar know whats right whats expected pull mask whatever occasion rise like describe exhausted keep even day day huge effort eating showering house cleaningi swear didnt animal depend id never anything lawd help husband suggests one time pajama arent necessarily day wear get better sound like taking step direction listening said thought trying help hear almost seems like youyour therapist combining disorder really different yes absolutely multiple one time feel important separate symptom instance say missing large swath timeptsd cause blackout blackout usually replaced ptsd trauma recurrence know missing time present living trauma episode due depression describe drowning know friend may remember occasionholiday remember bit piece occasion water recall conversation snippet suddenly looking eye spoke dont remember much else ask question need saydo something water try ask question take drink make toast make joke attempt control cover lapse bursting surface start sound like experienced call half inhalf episode went really didnt want tried hard fun meaningful participation laughed jokedbut forced mean remember hard tried present dont remember event dont fondness sentimentality happiness feel like friendsfamily better friend guilt included remember say see fact page think could benefit help another professional im little concerned outwardly youre good mask current professional missed episode someone going question let try explain depression ptsd addiction side present public even close friendsfamily ptsd addiction disorder depression symptom combined defining characteristic depression depression unrelated ptsd disorder related addiction im explaining well depression big picture origin symptomsissues depression symptom ptsd related trauma depression symptom addiction based solely addiction behavior still depression different impact panic attack able recognize come bam im use counting im publicits control overt also recite song head weird dont always remember know episode childhood song jesus love one remember cant even remember name suggestion ex hard core alcoholic quit replaced every drink physical activity im ptsd episode even push ups wall walkrun stair hard feel energized anything hopefully help fear going back trauma letting image smellsi break literally running away singing song hope something helpsbut arent alone,SUBJECTIVE

Alcohol is an extreme drug in that it is fast acting and requires you to constantly have to drink more and more in order to continue to feel ok. People who have had clinical depression should never drink because drinking as a way of self medicating your depression involves being an alcoholic which is not a way to heal from depression. Not drinking may seem like the “pain” is 100x more because that’s how extreme alcohol is. It is 100x harder to recover from depression if you continue to drink. Step 1 in depression recovery is to just stop drinking alcohol. Yes it’s hard but you literally have no other choice but to quit the extreme drug. If you say it is too hard to quit alcohol then you need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous or if you have enough money or have someone with enough that cares in you not being an alcoholic go to rehab. Try to logically reason with urself while you are not intoxicated because if you are intoxicated and try and reaso with yourself you will not be as logical. One logical inconsistency is in the comments you say you concluded you don’t want to get better yet are posting on Reddit asking for help. Not trying to call you dumb but that is clearly a inconsistency and most likely caused by your alcohol use…,depression,positive,alcohol extreme drug fast acting requires constantly drink order continue feel ok people clinical depression never drink drinking way self medicating depression involves alcoholic way heal depression drinking may seem like “ pain ” 100x that ’ s extreme alcohol 100x harder recover depression continue drink step 1 depression recovery stop drinking alcohol yes it ’ s hard literally choice quit extreme drug say hard quit alcohol need go alcoholic anonymous enough money someone enough care alcoholic go rehab try logically reason urself intoxicated intoxicated try reaso logical one logical inconsistency comment say concluded don ’ t want get better yet posting reddit asking help trying call dumb clearly inconsistency likely caused alcohol use…,SUBJECTIVE

"This was pretty much the same thing I went through for many years...FOr me it turned out I was diagnosed as one thing when something else was the cause...A change of meds was a total game changer...Another game changer was I spent years seeing a therapist who I didn't click with..Therapy seemed more like a chore then therapeutic.. There wasn't anything wrong with the therapist I was seeing, in fact they were very qualified and experienced..The problem was her and I did not ""click""...Our personalities were very different and it caused a barrier for me being completely open and honest..So it's great you love your current therapist..I don't think it matters if you keep fucking up your words or if you say things perfectly...they are there to help you grow..I think the fact that you are able to identify that you feel like you don't make any sense, is a positive sign that therapy is working..We live in a society that wants everything now now now...Changes that are instant and watching social media filled with highlight reels of everyone's life. My point is finding the right therapist, coping mechanism, medication, tool and so on is a lot of trial and error...But going through the trial and error made the downs hard so I completely emphasize when going through the down part...   I think you should applaud yourself for recognizing that you needed help and took the steps to change...As minor as that may seem it speaks volumes to admit problems exist..A lot of people don't..The fact that you did is pretty awesome!!! I think it's great you are talking to your therapist, as it's one more step you're going in the right direction. To me tripping over your words is normal...But that's also something I do...I can articulate words on paper, but can barely say an order at McDonalds...For me I think it's that my brains process things faster than how fast I can speak...You say you ""pretend you are different"" or ""pretend you have a ton of stuff going on for you"" but you didn't elaborate?What exactly is a ""ton of stuff going on""?  Are you pretending or have you identified your future goals? ""Pretending"" would be telling people you were snow white...Being goal oriented is telling people you enjoy indie films even if you've only seen one...  The only thing wrong with ""pretending"" is how the word is used..Everyone pretends everyday...When people ask ""how are you doing""...I pretend by saying""oh I am fine how are you""..In reality I feel like my life is falling apart and most of the time I am only asking how they are because it's engrained in me to respond this way...  ""Pretending"" isn't always a negative thing...In fact that's why social media platforms are so popular..I want to speculate that you're younger and if that is the case my heart goes out to all young people today...Society today is pretty much virtual and as good as technology is, I feel there is a lot of negative aspects to our mental health....By no means am I dismissing your feelings but from what you wrote of ""pretending"" it seems as if you feel your life, thoughts or interests should be one way? But because they aren't there must be something wrong with you? The fact is you are growing..No matter your age, people grow....Just because you liked drawing and the guitar seven years ago does not mean you MUST like it now...There is no rule or law that says your interest can not change...it is okay to lose interest...Now if you want to draw but have no interest in doing so thats a discussion best left to a professional...But if you think there is something wrong because you have lost interest, I think this means you are growing as a person..If anything it shows how interesting you are...it's okay to have ebbs and flow with interests....Human beings never stop growing.....Interests always change...  I also think there is a lot to be said in ""fake it till you make it""... I pretend on a daily basis that I am always happy and have not a care in the world, that I'm a professional woman who likes to look put together, be financially secure and a have a wide variety of interests...but in reality my ADHD causes me to have hundreds of hobbies, I have to force myself to smile, I never wanted to rely on anyone, and grew up in an environment with a mother who put a lot of pressure on physical appearances, weight and see a therapist weekly.  The fact that you used to draw and play the guitar illustrates you have a creative side...and creative people by nature are much more interesting than non creative...You stopped playing the guitar because you lost interest or because you ""were shit at it""...  We see so many young people today become well known early in their life merely from posting a viral video or born into a well known family...This has set a bar extremely high for young people today when you can be deemed ""great or an influencer"" simply because of a last name and a great marketing team.  But when you really look at people who have done great things or changed the world, you'll realize they were normal like the rest of us... None of them had it figured out at 20 or even 30 but spent years honing a craft after thousands of people telling them they were shit..  Jimi Hendrix was one of the best guitar players of all time..You know he didn't pick up the guitar and have this natural god gifted talent..He wasn't a prodigy. He spent 8-12 hours a day perfecting his craft...  Julia Child is known for bringing French cuisine to the American public and one of the most well known chefs. She was 50 when she started cooking...  Martha Stewart was in her 40s when her first cookbook got published...  The fact is the bar has been set so high for young people today it's caused this shift that being normal must mean there is something wrong with them...I don't want it to seem as if i'm minimizing your feelings or anything I say is right... I'm just throwing out things to hopefully help even a small way...",depression,positive,pretty much thing went many yearsfor turned diagnosed one thing something else causea change med total game changeranother game changer spent year seeing therapist didnt click withtherapy seemed like chore therapeutic wasnt anything wrong therapist seeing fact qualified experiencedthe problem clickour personality different caused barrier completely open honestso great love current therapisti dont think matter keep fucking word say thing perfectlythey help growi think fact able identify feel like dont make sense positive sign therapy workingwe live society want everything nowchanges instant watching social medium filled highlight reel everyones life point finding right therapist coping mechanism medication tool lot trial errorbut going trial error made down hard completely emphasize going part think applaud recognizing needed help took step changeas minor may seem speaks volume admit problem exista lot people dontthe fact pretty awesome think great talking therapist one step youre going right direction tripping word normalbut thats also something doi articulate word paper barely say order mcdonaldsfor think brain process thing faster fast speakyou say pretend different pretend ton stuff going didnt elaboratewhat exactly ton stuff going pretending identified future goal pretending would telling people snow whitebeing goal oriented telling people enjoy indie film even youve seen one thing wrong pretending word usedeveryone pretend everydaywhen people ask doingi pretend sayingoh fine youin reality feel like life falling apart time asking engrained respond way pretending isnt always negative thingin fact thats social medium platform populari want speculate youre younger case heart go young people todaysociety today pretty much virtual good technology feel lot negative aspect mental healthby mean dismissing feeling wrote pretending seems feel life thought interest one way arent must something wrong fact growingno matter age people growjust liked drawing guitar seven year ago mean must like nowthere rule law say interest changeit okay lose interestnow want draw interest thats discussion best left professionalbut think something wrong lost interest think mean growing personif anything show interesting areits okay ebb flow interestshuman being never stop growinginterests always change also think lot said fake till make pretend daily basis always happy care world im professional woman like look put together financially secure wide variety interestsbut reality adhd cause hundred hobby force smile never wanted rely anyone grew environment mother put lot pressure physical appearance weight see therapist weekly fact used draw play guitar illustrates creative sideand creative people nature much interesting non creativeyou stopped playing guitar lost interest shit see many young people today become well known early life merely posting viral video born well known familythis set bar extremely high young people today deemed great influencer simply last name great marketing team really look people done great thing changed world youll realize normal like rest u none figured 20 even 30 spent year honing craft thousand people telling shit jimi hendrix one best guitar player timeyou know didnt pick guitar natural god gifted talenthe wasnt prodigy spent 812 hour day perfecting craft julia child known bringing french cuisine american public one well known chef 50 started cooking martha stewart 40 first cookbook got published fact bar set high young people today caused shift normal must mean something wrong themi dont want seem im minimizing feeling anything say right im throwing thing hopefully help even small way,SUBJECTIVE

"Definitely get your dog into a safe home or shelter away from you immediately.   If you are not able to keep yourself or those around you safe (including animals) then you need to go to the emergency room. Otherwise you need to make an emergency appointment with your psychiatrist if you have one or at least your doctor so you can get referred to one.  I do understand that pets can be frustrating. I remember the one and only time I had a flash of anger at my cat, when I was trying to make a sandwich and he kept jumping up onto the counter to get at it. No matter how many times I placed him back on the floor, he jumped up again. I felt a flash of anger and almost lost control for a second and felt like I could have used excess force the last time when I was relocating him back onto the floor. I had to stop what I was doing, put the cat in the bathroom for a few minutes, and take a few deep breaths. Then I thought about how stubborn he was being, and how stubborn I often was, and immediately my anger left me. Like mother like son, right? And here he was, my baby, acting just as obnoxious as I’m sure I myself was frequently right around that same time in my life. That really put his behaviour into perspective for me, and from then on everytime we had a battle over the counter space it just made me laugh. I don’t know if this helps you at all, but it really helped me. The heckin good boi just wanted the peanut butter. Who can blame him for that?  They even tell mothers who are about to lose their tempers with crying, colicky babies that it’s ok to put the baby in a safe place (like a crib) and leave the room and go to a quiet place for five minutes and just let the baby cry while the mother takes a breather and collects herself.

"The other comments have given good advice, but I have something to add.  As someone with an eating disorder, I still tend to eat when someone eats with me. That being said, if I'm eating more than the other person, it makes me feel horrible and i'll ""get rid"" of that food.  That may or may not trigger your girlfriend too, but I'd be careful. If/when your girlfriend is comfortable speaking to you about her ed, ask her about things that make her do stuff like purging, starving etc. To make sure you never make her do those things. In general, snacking with a friend does help me eat. But I also tend to purge if I eat a lot of the thing, for example, half a bag. So make sure you don't overdo your help (or it might strike back, so to say)   I'd also not comment on her body. What I've noticed as I've lost weight is that people do notice it, and they point it out. Blame the culture or whatever.. Anyway, it makes me uncomfortable even if I like being skinny. Your girlfriend is a beautiful girl I'll assume, and a beautiful face is even more beatiful with a thriving, healthy body.  I find modern diet culture really dangerous. Not only does it make someone unhealthy, it also makes a person weak. An underweight person or a person who's losing weight in a fast pace won't have the energy a normal person does. An underweight person will literally be way weaker, especially against a grown man. That means it's harder to defend yourself, and overall get trough life. I was semi-assaulted like a week back, and just then I thought about how I wouldn't be able to do shit against the man even if I wanted to.  I don't know where I was going with this, just a mini rant I guess. You want your girlfriend to be safe, though, so it's on point enough  Anyway, I hope you and especially your girlfriend the best. Recovery is a hard journey, but it's very much worth it. I would recommend that if your girlfriends starts eating normally (And you're sure she is), you two start going to the gym.

"Hi, I get your frustration. I'm currently doing CBT and I've done it in the past. I think therapy for an anxiety disorder (or any for that matter) is actually more complicated than people think. I.e. it's not a simple 'just do X many times and it will reduce X.' There are so many elements that go together in recovering, and they should be tailored to the person and there should be some sensitivity involved as to what works and what doesn't (which a good therapist would be able to pick up on/guide you through). I had a therapist in the past who did actually say that social phobia can be tricky, because overstretching yourself/exposing yourself to something that you're not equipped to handle can completely backfire and reinforce anxiety/fear/self doubt.      I've definitely tried what some people advise which is to just throw myself into new social situations, and made myself go to social events which terrified me and definitely made me much more insecure and drained. It did not help at all and I achieved nothing by doing that. I completely agree that other techniques have to be involved too, like emotional regulation and even learning social skills. I think some therapists focus too much on cognition and the exposure itself, where in theory your anxiety will reduce after some time and you'll realise 'you can handle it' and 'it's not as bad as your fear.' But social phobia is not like the phobia of an inanimate object, where obviously it's a one way street. Social anxiety comes also from not knowing what to do/say in a social situation, how to connect with people and reciprocate, it can be quite complex actually. So, it's not enough to just be exposed but to develop the skills to be able to engage successfully in a situation I feel. You don't automatically learn that through exposure alone.",socialanxiety,positive,hi get frustration im currently cbt ive done past think therapy anxiety disorder matter actually complicated people think ie simple x many time reduce x many element go together recovering tailored person sensitivity involved work doesnt good therapist would able pick onguide therapist past actually say social phobia tricky overstretching yourselfexposing something youre equipped handle completely backfire reinforce anxietyfearself doubt ive definitely tried people advise throw new social situation made go social event terrified definitely made much insecure drained help achieved nothing completely agree technique involved like emotional regulation even learning social skill think therapist focus much cognition exposure theory anxiety reduce time youll realise handle bad fear social phobia like phobia inanimate object obviously one way street social anxiety come also knowing dosay social situation connect people reciprocate quite complex actually enough exposed develop skill able engage successfully situation feel dont automatically learn exposure alone,SUBJECTIVE

I’m sorry you had try go through something like that, but it’s likely you’ll never have to do that again or at least for a really long time.   Let me tell you your life absolutely has meaning. It’s not as simple as getting over anxiety. Your mom probably don’t know how bad it is. I’m not there, so I don’t know the full story. But I have things that helped me.  One of the biggest things (which is hard) is to not compare yourself to others. Don’t fall into the trap. It’s only going to make yourself feel worse.  The 2nd thing is to find your passion or things you enjoy. Once you find what you love doing it will light a fire in your heart.  And no matter how hard it gets, you’ve always survived 100% of your worst days. We are all here to support you. And don’t dwell pressured into doing it. If something makes you extremely anxious you don’t have to do it. It just creates unnecessary stress. And you deserve positivity.   I know what you went through was terrible. Saying hi for me is hard, so I can’t imagine doing what you did. But all of that is in the past now and it’s over.  Give yourself time to relax and let your mom know how much it affects you. It isn’t just shyness. And you posting on here is also shows you want to keep trying. It shows your character. Not many people could do something like post on here. Asking for help is the hardest thing. Deep down inside you want to get better. And even you posting this on here is a huge accomplishment.  I looked back at the post and I can’t talk to people either. I get how hard that is. There’s always other ways to communicate too. When I can’t speak I’ll write down what I want to say in a notebook. Or type it.  Just whatever you do, don’t end your life. You are worth more than you think. You deserve to be happy and this is a good first step. Some days will be good and some will be bad.

If ur not feeling like dinner, maybe a snack?” People with ED’s tend to do better with smaller portions infront of them bc it’s not as overwhelming. With my ED, I live on snacks and have maybe 3 meals out of the whole week (I know it’s crazy, and the best part is that they are lean cuisines)!! I don’t know if ur daughter calorie counts or just does simply not eat, but if she calorie counts then stick to the foods she can count. Don’t add oil, butter, sauce, etc. Sometimes feeding into the ED mind (in the beginning) makes it safer for the person. As I always say, something is better then nothing. Sadly, many times we avoid the pleasurable sugary foods bc of the fear of weight so maybe encourage nutritional balanced meals.

"My psychosis event that lead to my eventual diagnosis 10 years ago stemmed from a manic delusion that the Two Witnesses of the Apocalypse from Revelation 11 were me and the prophet Moses. I believed that I had been given a prophetic message from God to warn that the 7 years of apocalyptic tribulation had begun and that ISIS was going to expand into an empire that conquered Europe, Africa and Asia with their leader being the antichrist.   I was fully convinced that I had the ability to control weather around the planet and breathe fire on anyone who threatened me. I also thought that 4 of the other patients in the psych ward were actually angels they were sent to protect me specifically.   To make matters worse, there were only a couple books lying around to pass the time. One of them was the Bible and another was the Christian Apocalyptic book “Left Behind”. I can’t imagine a worse book for a mental health ward than a Christian thriller novel about the Antichrist but the presence of that book in the ward probably added two weeks to my psychosis. There was also a homeless guy in there that repeatedly told me that he was a demon and that he was going to murder me and then rape my corpse in hell.   I had a very conservative Christian upbringing and the subsequent depressive episode that came when I finally broke my delusion completely shattered my faith. It wasn’t that I didn’t believe in God, I could no longer trust my own perceptions of reality. When I realized that I could be so devastatingly wrong about such an extraordinary belief made me question everything I believed. Ironically, in some ways I think my faith is stronger today than it was before because of the critical approach I take to any piece of information that’s presented to me.   After many years of medication, therapy, and meditation, I have slowly learned how to have faith in something that I cannot prove with any level of certainty such as the resurrection and ascension of Christ.  My advice if you are looking for ways to strengthen your faith is to read “Mere Christianity” by C.S. Lewis and “The Case for Christ” by Lee Strobel.  Lewis’s book argues for the existence of God and the legitimacy of the Gospel’s claim that Jesus Christ was the Son of God ([Lewis’s Trilema](https://youtu.be/5YwjhTaZnlw?si=Ee4m7hI3DpH1BNI-)).

"I have a cleft palate. Here's what helped me.   A compilation of a few things:  - Embrace being uncomfortable. Say hi and make light conversations to random strangers or people who you don't know very well at school. It's awkward, but with repetition, it will be more comfortable talking to people.   - Find a hobby or do something you're really proud of. Search for long-term gratification. Whether that be joining a gym, growing plants, or working on your car. Find something that you love to enjoy doing and work on that damn near every day!  - Study people. Whenever you feel anxious around people, try to figure out what their insecurity might be. We all have them. That doesn't mean you become vicious and make fun of them for it or shit talk to your friends about them. It's to teach you that we ALL live in our own heads. Knowing that 7 out of 10 people in the room are on edge makes me feel less anxious.  - Avoid caffeine if you can. Sadly, kids today are judged by the energy drink they consume. One or two cups of coffee throughout the entire day is fine, but if you're drinking more energy drinks than water itself, that will 1000% increase your anxiety levels.  -Take your vitamins. I know it sounds dumb, but it truly works. Your body needs certain minerals to function flawlessly, and if you're lacking, it'll start to malfunction. For social anxiety, I strongly recommend taking Vitamin D and Magnesium GLYCINATE together daily.  - Love yourself. No one gives a fuck if you're ugly. No one cares if you're poor and wear the same clothes every day. No one cares that you're fat! Remember that EVERYONE is in their own head. Love yourself, you give off a more confident vibe, and other people will sub consciously notice and be at more ease with your presence. When you're uptight and on edge, other people will pick up that negative vibe it bounces back to you feeding your anxiety.  I love talking to people with a lisp. I instantly feel at ease and its comforting with people who have them. It's s nothing to be ashamed of. Own it. Laugh at it.   Lastly, fucking smile once in a while. We're all floating on a rock.

"This is all just my NON-PROFESSIONAL opinion, but I too was told by my team that they would prefer the in-patient route. I absolutely could not do that - I would have lost my job and I don't do well away from my safe people and my home. I had to get cleared by an ED specialist, and they too recommended in-patient for me, but since I was medically stable and refused in-patient, my outpatient team reluctantly agreed to see how I did not going to a center. Here I am, 6 months later, healing via outpatient. How? My team straight up told me ""you keep this up, you don't have too many years left in you"" and that was my ONLY motivation that I clung to for the longest time. It seems that you have that same fear driving you, but it's up to you to keep that motivation for treatment in mind. No one can make you recover fully, even in in-patient, except for you. They can give you the tools you need to help and restore the weight (if necessary) and can give you the extra support that some people need, but at the end of the day, fully committing to it is a choice only you can make.  **This is not me saying that you don't need in-patient care.** I don't know you, your health situation, or how much treatment/support you need.

"Always difficult dealing with a partner living with schizophrenia. I'm in a similar boat, not my first Rodeo either!  Basically, if he is suffering from untreated symptoms he has two choices, he voluntarily enters into community treatment, meaning doctors appointments, medication, therapy etc. Or he doesn't and the condition worsens to the point that hospitalisation is inevitable. The first option is often extremely difficult, as many schizophrenia patients don't even believe they are unwell, even if it is dead obvious to you and their other friends/ family. Experiencing distrust in strangers/ clinical settings or related delusions makes it all that much more difficult.   But in short what im saying is if he's passed the point of seeking help voluntarily, an involuntary hospitalisation is inevitable and necessary as it's the only environment that the doctors can keep a close eye on him as they figure out a medication and dosage that will stabilise him and get him to the next stage of recovery.  I'm not sure what support systems you have available to you but my partner just recently relapsed after coming off her meds and I was able to reach out to a mental health line and that set a series of events in motion that's going to get her the help she needs. I rang the line on Monday, They called to check on her/ assess her on Tuesday, organised a doctor's appointment for a psych eval on Wednesday that she bailed on despite my best efforts, and today Thursday, they have sent a doctor and her old case worker to see her at home and assess her. I think they'll be hospitalising her because her condition is the worst it's ever been in my experience.  I know it's tough on you, but it's even tougher on your partner. Try you best to be as supportive and understanding as you can. If you at all feel like he is at risk of harming himself or others, do not hesitate to call emergency services.

"Absolutely possible. Sorry in advance for how long this is about to be. While I’m aware that nobody force feeds us, I’ll give you two personal examples on how social/environmental factors can influence us to cave in. Example one: my former best friend was very active in the gym and has a naturally high metabolism, but she also had a binge eating disorder. I was bulimic and overweight with no experience in the gym. Any time I would hang out with her at her house, she would give into binging, but not without guilting me into binging with her so she didn’t have to feel bad or alone. She’d plead with me to binge with her, and I’d decline and tell her “I don’t go to the gym or have your metabolism. This will trigger my bulimia.” She didn’t want me throwing up, BUT had zero issue with trying to guilt me into engaging with her own disordered eating. Example two: an ex boyfriend of mine always had trouble holding down a job, so I was supporting us with my shitty $10/hour part time job. He also had a high metabolism and ate like a monster. All of my groceries that I’d spend a majority of my check on would be gone in two days, and I’d barely see any of it. He wasn’t eating to live. He was eating because he was bored and jobless. So what did I do? I’d eat more than what was necessary just to feel like I was benefiting from my own paycheck. There’s no controlling your portions when you’re consumed with the anxiety of not knowing when your next meal will be because the literal fucking human garbage disposal inhales everything you just bought.",EatingDisorders,positive,absolutely possible sorry advance long i ’ m aware nobody force feed u i ’ ll give two personal example socialenvironmental factor influence u cave example one former best friend active gym naturally high metabolism also binge eating disorder bulimic overweight experience gym time would hang house would give binging without guilting binging didn ’ t feel bad alone she ’ d plead binge i ’ d decline tell “ i don ’ t go gym metabolism trigger bulimia ” didn ’ t want throwing zero issue trying guilt engaging disordered eating example two ex boyfriend mine always trouble holding job supporting u shitty 10hour part time job also high metabolism ate like monster grocery i ’ d spend majority check would gone two day i ’ d barely see wasn ’ t eating live eating bored jobless i ’ d eat necessary feel like benefiting paycheck there ’ s controlling portion you ’ re consumed anxiety knowing next meal literal fucking human garbage disposal inhales everything bought,SUBJECTIVE

"I don't have good advice, no one else has responded so I'll give it a shot. I'm guessing no one else has responded because this is an unusual problem.  Maybe you feel depressed while dating because dating can be stressful and daunting. It's difficult to find someone that looks promising and if you do, there is a good chance problems with the person will appear that will make it not work, or they'll decide you aren't for them. Not dating gets rid of this stress, you don't need to worry about this issue. Long-term not dating will obviously mean you are alone and you clearly don't want that.  What if you don't actively look for someone? Try to not think about looking to date someone and if someone appears that looks really promising, then try dating.

"It sounds like you're in a pretty tough, place emotionally. Unfortunately, I can definitely relate. When I was 19, I was surrounded by really unsupportive people who made me feel worthless. Also, for me, finding a sexual partner was more about finding someone who made me feel less alone (my family is dysfunctional) than just the physical part (although, that was an important part, too!)  I'm guessing that this might be similar to what you're experiencing (if not, my apologies for making an unfair assumption). And if this is indeed the case, it sounds like you have a tough slog ahead of you - but not impossible! I want to stress this: You. Can. Do. This.   And you don't have to do it alone. I would definitely recommend that you start by finding a better therapist. The situation you described with this person was appallingly abusive. A good therapist is supposed to take your concerns seriously and give you helpful strategies to deal with your interpersonal difficulties - not to re-victimize and bully you. This might be a good place for you to start because it's a more controlled environment where you know you'll be treated with respect.  If finding therapy where you live is hard, there are other options like online therapy with services like Betterhelp or Talkspace. It's a little easier to find a wider variety of therapists and you can filter out the search by finding out what different therapists specialize in.   Just to let you know: it took until I was almost 24 to find someone I was compatible enough to be intimate with. But I also know that when you're 19, it can seem like an eternity. I won't lie to you and say it was no big deal. Being alone was agonizing but the experience gave me the time I needed to determine what kind of partner I wanted to be with. Going out and getting life experiences can really help to bring you closer to finding the person you're meant to be with. No dream is too big: travel if you can, or just join different local groups, take up new interests you might not have considered. You never know where it will take you - or WHO you might meet. Please give yourself another chance: you're worth it.

"It’s difficult to say for sure but what you are experiencing is definitely a form of anxiety. The question is… do these symptoms occur just at the thought of going outside? Or do they also occur when you have to go out with friends, attend school or visit family for example? What about talking on the phone or meeting new people? Does spending time around strangers make you very uncomfortable or very self-conscious?  I have to disclaim that I’m not qualified to diagnose you, of course, so this is more like suggestions of research for your own understanding but if your anxiety is mainly around going outside and finding yourself in situations where you’re helpless or very far out of your comfort zone it might be agoraphobia as opposed to social anxiety- but you can also have both. The difference between social anxiety and agoraphobia is that the latter is related to being outside of your ‘safe space’, it can be triggered by feelings of helplessness or feeling trapped in crowded places for example. Meanwhile social anxiety is more centred around situations which might force you to interact with others, being overly self conscious when doing so or even being overwhelmed even if you’re in a familiar environment such as school or in the house when there’s other people like distant family visiting.  It does sound like your anxiety is severely impacting your life though, as it’s doing for many of us on this sub. I would recommend to talk to your fiancé about it if you feel comfortable enough to, having him understand can help you feel like you have a trust ‘figure’ to hold on to and maybe that will give you a bit of the calm/bravery you need to make a visit to the grocery store.  Also, consider talking to your GP. It might be possible that they can do a phone consultation so you don’t have to go to the clinic. They will be able to diagnose you or even make further recommendations.  As for the nausea and panic attacks, I struggle with those and they forced me to leave my work placement because there wasn’t a day I would wake up in the morning and not breakdown. Try some breathing exercises and mindfulness to see if they work for you. Breathing exercises help me sleep, and I use sleepcasts to help me take my mind off the ‘big’ thing happening in the future that’s making my anxiety flare up. I use Headspace, but it’s not a free app, I believe there is another app specifically for anxiety called Clear Fear which is free. I haven’t tried it myself but it’s a recommended resource and has good reviews.  I’m really sorry for how you’re feeling, I know how awful it can be and thinking about how it makes having a stable job seem impossible and really limits your options in terms of career is damn awful.

"I think for me social anxiety it comes from being sheltered as a kid. Yes, I had friends and neighborhood friends, but when it came to the going over my friends house I never did that until I was about 14 years old, plus I was the only child growing up.   My mom was old school because if I was playing outside as a kid I would have to come inside when the street lights came on and stayed in eye distance.    I’m not too sure why my mom was so strict but she was in terms of hanging out or sleeping over friends house. I did have a best friend who at the time lived right in back of my house on the other street which was cool because I would go in the backyard lmao and hang with her.   In high school I didn’t really notice but I would get shy or quiet not knowing at the time that it was social anxiety in a different form.   As an adult when I went to college friends went and came , I also fell out with a few best friends ending of HS. And one BestF ending of college. I still had friends but not many.   My social anxiety indeed came from my childhood and now I don’t have much friends that I hang out with, however, I can maintain conversation and it mainly happens when I am in crowded area with a lot of people it doesn’t always happen but when it does it hard to manage because I overthink shit that doesn’t matter to others bc nobody really cares.    But I would like to improve myself as a whole in towards getting shit done that holds me back such as social anxiety.

"This is actually a great post worthy of discussion.  I wrote my graduate research paper on social anxiety having suffered from it myself, and one distinction of it made in research is that it is not merely being shy.  A big difference is that people who suffer from social anxiety disorder as opposed to just shyness, often do worse in life.  It affects them to the point where they are less successful, take worse jobs, are less satisfied with their spouses, etc.  There is a high comorbidity between social anxiety disorder and substance abuse as a coping mechanism.  I think part of the disconnect is with the words ""social anxiety"" - there is social anxiety and then there is social anxiety *disorder*.  If you suffer from the latter you know that it's much different than someone you'd view as shy.  You know that you've probably talked to someone about it and they tell you ""oh, I'm really nervous too - just do this or that"" and you know inside that what their perception of anxiety is far different from yours.  That is not to say that the perspective is unhelpful, but it's an important distinction, especially if you are someone who suffers from the actual disorder.",socialanxiety,positive,actually great post worthy discussion wrote graduate research paper social anxiety suffered one distinction made research merely shy big difference people suffer social anxiety disorder opposed shyness often worse life affect point le successful take worse job le satisfied spouse etc high comorbidity social anxiety disorder substance abuse coping mechanism think part disconnect word social anxiety social anxiety social anxiety disorder suffer latter know much different someone youd view shy know youve probably talked someone tell oh im really nervous know inside perception anxiety far different say perspective unhelpful important distinction especially someone suffers actual disorder,SUBJECTIVE

From what little I’ve seen of what you’ve written, you’re thinking about your kids, seeking care, and working to make your family’s life work. I grew up with a mother that’s basically the opposite of that, and it was pretty much all I thought about. I’ve forgiven her but I wouldn’t say we have a relationship.   To clarify my point, my personal experience as the child of a bipolar parent is that it’s less important what you do than who you are as a person. Even if they’re miffed, they’re kids and they were going to be over something else if not a bona fide medical condition, but as adults what they’ll remember is you trying to make yourself the best version of you that you could be for their sakes.

I used to suffer with the same thing:  Here's how i overcame it.  1. Meditation: meditation allows you to observe your thoughts and behaviors which helps you control the impulse of asking for sorry.  2. Intentional offending a bit: start by intentionally doing things which would offend people a LITTLE BIT or things that you would apologise for. Doing this would expose you to the thoughts and feelings which make you impulsively say sorry. Observe what you're currently feeling and thinking in the moment like when meditating and CHOOSE to not apologize still and carry the conversation forward. See what happens. If it works please tell me that way I'll know i was able to help someone 😁. If any problems come up ask me.

The problem, I find, with society is that if you're not an ape beating your chest (akin to peacocking) then you're fucked. I'm so sick of this and have dreamed of starting some kind of movement for us introverts. I think social anxiety stems from being an introvert. The whole idea of having to perform, and the dreaded small talk. I'm 40 now and I'm finding it easier to accept myself. Not only that but i'm starting to appreciate the fact that i'm different. I feel more comfortable not making small talk now. I'm so sick of wasting valuable energy worrying that i'm not performing to peoples expectations. I've always found it supremely bizarre to be at ease with people I don't know. People are just performing. And I know its necessary for breaking the ice, but it just reeks of inauthenticity and it makes me so uncomfortable.    Don't get me wrong, i'm all for talking to people, if the conversation is real. But I just find that most people aren't like that.   My advice to you is to just not give a fuck.

"There's no law that says you have to try, but if you want to, here's some advice a friend of mine says is good -  1. Know when to stop. This may be the most important thing. You won't get better if you make yourself hate it. If you get frustrated, put the pencil down and come back to it later - an hour later on the next day. Try to end your session in a good mood.  2. Get good materials at a reasonable cost. A light pencil and a dark pencil are all you need. Ticonderoga Medium (2.5) is cheap and good. Faber-Castell is the world's best pencil and you can buy a dozen of their 3B pencils at Amazon. Buy a pencil extender to make them last. Tracing paper takes pencil very nicely and it's great for reworking a drawing you're not happy with. You can check for errors by turning the paper over. You can make a kneaded eraser any shape you like and use it as a drawing tool.  3. Learn the basics of composition. A lot of art instruction is teaching how to make the work look real, but that's pointless without good composition. There are tutorials for composition too.  4. The best drawings say something. Pretend that your drawing is an illustration for a story.  5. Don't worry about style. Just draw and that's your style.  6. Finally, here's a good teacher. he's smart and has a good sense of humor. Drawing the human figure realistically is important even if you just want to be a cartoonist.

I legit thought she accidentally sent the email to the wrong person lol. & somehow over the last three years I’ve worked my way up to leading the advanced esthetics program at the school.

"I used to evaluate for psychosis when I worked at a psych hospital. Sounds based of what you shared (not officially diagnosing here) that you had a pretty psychoactive experience with the edible. And even with edibles you can get to a point where you may experience hallucinations. It's not out of the realm of possibility. Typically one of the most defining factors in determining a possible psychosis is how much of a break from reality are you experiencing? Typically also during psychosis you aren't going to remember much detail about it. Your brain more or less goes offline. So if you remember vividly what happened, I'd lean towards having a very psychoactive experience. Keep in mind that GAD and OCD both are rooted in anxiety (among other things) and anxiety is a runaway train often times before it even leaves the station.

I’m sorry for the suffering you’re experiencing right now and i’m sure it’s really confusing and frustrating. The thing I would suggest the most is to try to get her help in the way of like maybe getting her an inpatient stay just so she can rest somewhere safe for a while if she doesn’t feel comfy around you. If you’re unable to I would get family or friends of hers to help because sometimes they don’t understand that we want to help so it helps to get others if possible.

I’m not saying it’s hopeless though but it is important for you to think about if this is something you can realistically live with, it’s not her fault she’s sick but you also have to make choices about what you’re willing to be there for and what you’re not. You would not be a bad person for leaving if that were to happen. I’d also suggest finding a therapist to talk to about some of these things cause it’s distressing on you too.

"Okay. Let’s unpack this. , and anchor you to some facts.   1. You are 19, and statistically have about 50-70 more years of life ahead of you. Your life is not “irreversibly over,” you have catastrophised this and that’s not a helpful way of thinking.  2. Masturbation is a normal and healthy thing for an adult human to do, and trying to restrain yourself from it is going to lead to frustration and it is shown to have long-term negative health effects.  3. Porn, consumed in moderation and from ethical sources, is not unhealthy either. Human interest in sex is natural and pornography existed before the invention of the camera.  4. That sex worker who masturbated you is a human being, and she performed a service you paid her to do. There is nothing wrong with consenting adults seeing sex workers to have needs met, and your description of her is disrespectful. You should be more respectful of the women who provide services you purchase. Your ideas of “honour” may be cultural or deeply valued to you, but that doesn’t mean you get to fling them around and degrade other people for not living to your personal code.  5. You may feel as though this wasn’t the right thing to do, but you did it and there was nothing wrong with it, other than it didn’t make you feel better and didn’t live up to your expectations.  6. Sex isn’t your entire life, and getting a girlfriend won’t fix your insecurities and anxieties. First times being magical gifts to be given is truly overblowing how important these things are in the grand scheme of your life. Additionally, future partners don’t even need to know if you don’t want them to. She used protection and no crimes were committed.

This is exactly how I feel. I went out on a work outing yesterday in a big group of us. God everyone was close linking arms in their little groups and I did not fit into any of them. We were walking round london and there was a bout five different small groups of everyone from work and I walked alone behind them all. Could just hear all their laughing and joking. I did even try to walk alongside of on of the groups and to interact in their conversations but they all sort of sped up anytime I got close or would whisper to one another so I couldn’t hear what they were saying and couldn’t interact even if I wanted to.   Most social situations are like that for me. I went out with my partner and his friends before Christmas. It was the same. I feel like an extra just tagging along when I’m reality nobody would give a shit or even notice if I was there or not. I’ve felt this way for years. Like im just the outcast.

"Hello, so this idea that we even *have* to motorist our weight is completely irrational and rooted in diet-culture. Before scales existed humans were just fine and able to assess their health by simply trusting and listening to body as likely body connection is there as they had a completely intuitive relationship with food. Before diet-culture existed and at birth—we were all born intuitive eaters. Intuitive eating means you have body connection and body trust and trust your body and listen to it rather than feeling the need to compensate, monitor, manipulate, and control. I officially smashed my scale the singular biggest tool my ED used to keep me stuck in an obsessive mindset surrounding body and food and “monitor” that control. A team of an intuitive eating dietician and ED therapist is the evidenced based treatment for eating disorders. I’ve worked with intuitive eating dieticians over the past DECADE of my recovery been in and out of treatment but outpatient long term treatment is where the true healing happens. I been through all levels of care and intuitive eating dietitians helped me to rebuild body connection and trust and realize that I never need to monitor my weight in order to know if I’m “healthy” when I simply have body connection and body trust. I trust my body with food. I respect and honor all hunger/fullness cues it send my way. I have healed relationship with body so I trust if something were truly wrong health wise body would tell me and I can tell by how I FEEL in my body not how I APPEAR in my body.   Many dieticians have told me they don’t use a scale because they have intuitive relationship with food and trust their body to tell them what it needs and can tell if they are healthy by how they feel in their bodies. You can know if you’ve gained weight by how clothes feel. This alone is still triggering for me though. Even though I can’t see the number and thank god for that because I would relapse if I saw the number— I can tell I’ve gained weight by how my clothes fit now. This is hard but part of recovery is challenging fat-phobia and fear of weight gain. I feel content in the body I live in right now despite the uncomfortable changes of growth. This is because growth in general is terrifying to me. But we cannot heal if we do not change and grow. Change and growth are such beautiful things in recovery. I have a much better more functional life however mental health is complex so always will be needing to work on self care and maintaining mental health especially when it comes to Serious mental illness such as eating disorders. We just may require more support to maintain our mental health along the way and that’s fine.

"If you drop out now, would you fail all your classes this semester, which could affect financial aid/grades/etc?  That would be one of my big concerns.

Would you be okay financially if you delayed a year?  Housing, expenses, all that?  If you did decide to drop out, could you take summer classes to ease the burden next fall semester where you need to write your thesis?  Personally, I empathize with your mental health more than finishing on time, but there are practical reasons that you might need to consider trying to tough it out.  Pushing graduation out a year is really not a big deal, at least in my opinion.  Your mental health is more important, and it could be necessary to get it in better shape to succeed in your thesis.  If you did decide to take time off, make sure you don't completely stay away from your academics, as you may end up feeling too overwhelmed when school starts back up, and decide to not finish your degree.

"It seems like an odd claim, that your psychiatrist has just told you that schizophrenia is curable and to stop taking your medication, I can only imagine there is aome context that would clarify this (e.g., the psychiatrist actually thinks you are in a good position to not relapse and taking you off medication would be beneficial, but that would be an assumption based on very little information). It is also possible that you are from somewhere where, say, cultural notions are influencing your psychiatrist in a problematic way. Again, not enough context and information to know.   Here's the thing, and it applies to so many just frankly bizarre posts in this sub: have you tried actually, you know, talking to your psychiatrist about it? When a psychiatrist is in dialogue with you and you have questions, or you are confused by something, or you may be not understanding something, you want your psychiatrist to clarify something, it seems like they are saying something that is not true or not correct, etc., have you tried... asking them? Talking to them?   I don't understand these posts, very, very, very few people have had experiences being diagnosed by a psychiatrist and meeting them to discuss treatment wherein they were unable to actually speak and, you know, have a dialogue with the person talking to them. It seems unlikely that people would meet with their treating professional, their psychiatrist, listen to what they say stone silent without saying a word, and then leave, go home, get on reddit, and ask a bunch of strangers to clarify what their psychiatrist apparently said to them.  Try talking to your psychiatrist about the questions you have, rather than seeking answers from anonymous strangers on reddit who literally cannot help you in any way.   Also, no, schizophrenia is not 'curable', there is no direct treatment for schizophrenia, there is no hard science even showing that we know what causes schizophrenia in a bio-medical model sense, and no way of directly treating the cause such that it could be cured. There are people who experience no psychosis relapses, but that is not the same as saying it is 'curable'.

"So I'm not a professional, but I can share some information I know and experience I've had myself.   So 'schizophrenia with bipolar symptoms' isn't a diagnosis in the DSM 5 or the ICD 11 (I that's what number they're up to now). You most likely have a schizophrenia diagnosis, with symptoms of bipolar noted, but not enough symptoms for a full diagnosis of bipolar. If you recieve a diagnosis of bipolar though, you will then have your diagnosis changed to schizoaffective (assuming your doctor actually knows what he's doing). Obviously I don't know you as well as I'm sure you're doctor does, but from what you've listed at least in this post, it sounds like you're bipolar (or at least schizoaffective), not schizophrenic.   So, from personal experience, I have had bipolar like symptoms due to schizophrenia, but it was never severe enough or persistent enough for it to be bipolar. During active psychosis, especially if I was having intense delusions, I'd often times become 'manic' for short periods of time. I'd have random violent outbursts (mostly verbal, but physical has happened), increased energy, physical agitation (increased fidgeting and couldn't keep still), racing thoughts and pressured speech (talking very fast). However, these symptoms for me only ever lasted a couple hours at most, and then I'd be completely fine for days (still in psychosis, but not manic).   The manic symptoms were often times related to a delusion. I impulsively started making lists on Amazon of books related to a spiritual belief I thought I was a representative of (e.g. God, Jesus, Allah kind of stuff), I wrote over 5 pages on A4 paper about this belief system and how I came to be what I am now because of it. There was a time I thought my neighbour was a pedo and I knew how to 'cure' him, and I started planning how I'd break into his house at night and fix him. All this impulsivity died down after a few hours though, meaning it wasn't related to bipolar, because the symptoms weren't consistent enough.   So, my examples above would be something like 'schizophrenia with bipolar symptoms'. However, what you described IS bipolar (especially eith how persistent the symptoms last).",schizophrenia,positive,im professional share information know experience ive schizophrenia bipolar symptom isnt diagnosis dsm 5 icd 11 thats number theyre likely schizophrenia diagnosis symptom bipolar noted enough symptom full diagnosis bipolar recieve diagnosis bipolar though diagnosis changed schizoaffective assuming doctor actually know he obviously dont know well im sure youre doctor youve listed least post sound like youre bipolar least schizoaffective schizophrenic personal experience bipolar like symptom due schizophrenia never severe enough persistent enough bipolar active psychosis especially intense delusion id often time become manic short period time id random violent outburst mostly verbal physical happened increased energy physical agitation increased fidgeting couldnt keep still racing thought pressured speech talking fast however symptom ever lasted couple hour id completely fine day still psychosis manic manic symptom often time related delusion impulsively started making list amazon book related spiritual belief thought representative eg god jesus allah kind stuff wrote 5 page a4 paper belief system came time thought neighbour pedo knew cure started planning id break house night fix impulsivity died hour though meaning wasnt related bipolar symptom werent consistent enough example would something like schizophrenia bipolar symptom however described bipolar especially eith persistent symptom last,SUBJECTIVE

"Ptsd is an invisible injury, and there's a lot of ignorance around it. It doesn't matter if you're smart, have a ton of degrees, or a dedicated work ethic. It's a severely disabling condition and it prevents you from being able to do work, or more often, being able to do work *consistently*. Some are able to manage at an accommodating workplace, but most of us don't.  Part of learning to life with PTSD is learning to separate your self-worth from your occupation, and to confront the stigma surrounding disability. Part of that is confronting and educating your friends and loved ones, and part of that is cutting toxic people from your life.

"So I’ve dealt with this upsetting thought after oversharing with a coworker as well. The two things that helped me calm down were:   1. This makes me realize that I need to stop oversharing with acquaintances. I don’t technically need to because f it it’s your life but it’s actually a good thing in hindsight for me, because for example I can be too negative and complain too much. I won’t overshare anymore in order to avoid other people thinking I’m weird, or to make sure others don’t tell people my business. But, also no longer oversharing also can benefit me by causing me to think more before I speak. But don’t let all of that make it so that you’re afraid to speak your mind or ramble about something.   2. This can be upsetting to think about, but for me it makes me feel better and I have to remind myself of it often. You can’t make other people not talk about you or stop talking about you. I finally felt better about this and understood it when I thought to myself “I like to think I’m a nice person, but honestly, when was the last time I gossiped about a person? Even if it wasn’t necessarily bad?”… and it was pretty recent. Why am I worried about others talking about me when I’m talking about others lol. We all talk about everything and everybody. We’re human, we communicate. The other day I finally snapped on my coworker for being rude and condescending for 6 straight months. Guess what, I turned around when he thought I was gone and he was whispering to my other coworker and looking directly at me, then immediately stopped and turned away. He was talking about me!

It's great if you can bury your head in the sand, but a lot of us can't, so it just sucks.  What matters most is our response.  While the balance of good and evil (or whatever language you want to use), I think favors evil in volume, I do believe that there is an even balance in terms of potential impact.  That is to say, for any evil deed, there is an equally good deed that could have been taken.  This, I think is what we should lean into, rather than being overwhelmed by the overall circumstance.  For meaning, I think you've answered your own question in part.  Your last sentence about helping others is, at least to me, is what gives life meaning.  Regardless of any ultimate purpose that you mention, we do know that we are here, and that suffering is real.  If suffering is real and matters (it does), then avoiding it, and sparing others from it, matters just as much.  You can find meaning in whatever you choose to.

Because there doesn't need to be a point unless you decide so. We are here now and we don't know why.

"I totally been in your shoes with my sister (except the criminal history). I decided to pursue adult guardianship after multiple IVCs and her unwillingness to take medication leading her to long period of catatonia where she would stop eating or drinking for days. The application in most cities now is online through the clerk of court's office and you do not need an attorney. Make sure you ask for an emergency proceeding as you will be appointed temporary guardian until permanent guardianship can be decided. This way you can get him found and placed back into the hospital. Your brother will be appointed an attorney called guardian ad litem (GAL) to represent him. If your brother has multiple IVCs, unable to remember his name, and lacks the capacity to take care of himself or handle his medication then he meets the criteria of being legally incompetent. Ultimately it would be up to you to either decide to take guardianship of him (if your mother declines) or ask he be made a ward of the state. I would suggest filing for guardianship while he is hospitalized. In my experience my sister received a more thorough workup in the hospital (6 months) once a petition for guardianship was filed as the hospital cannot discharge until judge decides on guardianship.  Also, guardianship is not all encompassing thing. If you choose to pursue guardianship over your brother  the courts are becoming more lenient with the idea of ""limited"" guardianship. With my sister she is able to handle all her affairs, decide where to live, retain her driving privileges, make doctors appointments but her medication I have the final say. The absolute best thing I ever done. It is a huge weight lifted off my shoulders to know that my sister could never ""refuse"" to take her meds or if she relapses I can immediately have her committed without an IVC.

"Hey, this is going to be a long read, I relate to you a lot. This is my personal experience with studies.  I can't say for sure there is some sort of end to it because I'm not there yet, but others will. I was studying for my dream job (being a vet) when my bipolar disorder became severe. I struggled a lot for the 1st year but pulled through. However, the next year was terrible. I was at rock bottom, I was on drugs, I couldn't bring myself to go to classes. My teachers and friends knew there was something wrong, and yours probably do as well ; it's not an easy subject to discuss with them but even sending a quick email saying you're going through some stuff and apologize (tho you have nothing to apologize for) for not being very invested goes a long way. My teachers only showed me support and understanding. I ended up quitting school completely after ending up in psychiatric hospital, going through manic phases, disappointing my parents, attempting to go back to school again and failing again, disappointing loved-ones some more... However, I've been studying again since september, in vet school. It was scary, I made some sacrifices and I was scared to death of investing into these studies and not holding up. 6 months later, I'm doing great, I am motivated more than ever and it has never been on my mind to quit once.  So this is a long rant but what I mean to say is that you are not doomed, you will get better and be able to do what you want, though there will probably be lows again. Don't hesitate to ask your school and psychiatrist for adjustments during your studies, there are special adjustments for people with a handicap (which can apply in your case since your condition prevents you from keeping up with studies) and it is a great first step to let your teaching staff know, it will get a weight off your mind.

"The recovery from any eating disorder and solution to disordered eating will never be any type of restriction and fasting is literally just restriction. There are actually very few health benefits to restriction at all. Restriction breeds body disconnection and body distrust and not to mention is a literal ED behavior listed under the DSM-5. There is not a “healthy” way to restrict and deprive the body. It’s not respectful and kind to the body to deny its most basic needs and ignore the hunger fullness question its desperately tries to communicate with you. It exasperates disordered cognitions and behaviors surrounding food. If your goal here is to recover from an eating disorder, the solution is ED treatment. The current evidence based treatment for ALL eating disorder diagnosis is indeed a team of INTUITIVE eating dietician and a ED specializing therapist. The “affirmations” in terms of restrictive and disordered eating confuses me. So instead of positive affirmations just basically disordered cognitions and trying to think of positive statement to help you restrict and further engage in disordered eating? That’s not an affirmation, that’s a disordered cognition. Food rules and restrictions breed disordered cognitions.   Intuitive eating helps us to reconnect to body. We were all born intuitive eaters before we were influenced by diet-culture and normalized disordered eating patterns and normalized disordered thoughts and judgments surrounding food. Diet-culture attaches morality to food, food judgments, and food rules breeding an obsessive and rigid relationship with food rather than a NATURAL and INTUITIVE one.   The evidence based treatment is team of intuitive dietician and therapist. I’ve been through actual propped ED treatment first admission when I was 15 and now 25 fully recovered has many relapses in college but now I’m recovered. The proper treatment entails seeking a ED therapist and intuitive eating dietician maybe even working outpatient first but if behaviors and mentality and physical complications get worse then a higher level of care may be recommended.

If medication helps you, please do your best to take it or find one that gives you the most benefit without taking away any talents or good feelings you may have left.

Thankfully I have a cat that helps me stay happy and sane. Companions as such help us immensely with our mental health.   Anyway; though I still have episodes more than I'd like, I think in the long run as we put effort into learning about ourselves and the world around us, with age having schizophrenia doesn't seem bad at all so far.

Even if it’s doing something he enjoys or wants to do he just won’t/can’t seem to get started. I have bipolar and stuff and I can relate.

Also make time for self care! That’s been hard for me to do. For so many years my “self care” has been zoning out on my phone. But I’ve come to realize that’s just an escape. Which is fine sometimes but really making myself journal or meditate whatever your thing is just force yourself to do at least that one thing everyday even if it’s just for 5 minutes. So try to do that and be kind to yourself! Don’t beat yourself up because of what you didn’t do but what you did. I know that’s not easy but it’s definitely the most important thing for yourself.. Somedays I still struggle with that but it makes a huge difference! Remember you have a real illness and that’s ok! Even if society says it’s not and people judge you!

Ultimately restricting leads to huge binge urges because your body is starving and it overrides any other concerns for health when your body is trying to survive.

"It can be tough dealing with social anxiety, especially at a young age. Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way! One thing that might help is to start small, like talking to new people in a low-pressure setting. Practice deep breathing or mindfulness to calm your nerves in social situations.   Also, try not to be too hard on yourself; everyone has their own journey. As for your lisp, don't let it hold you back! Embrace who you are, and others will too.

Well at the very least you certainly display disordered and disregulated eating which IS common and associated with many other co-occurring mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression. Our mood and mood disorders can overlap and interfere with eating experiences and contribute as barriers to eating. If you are struggling with relationship with food and eating adequately and consistently not only is this indicative of a restrict eating disorder but you deserve help for the mere fact you struggle with food period. Full blown ED or not same medical outcomes from ED behaviors such as restriction. Unintentional restriction is commonly associated with ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) which means sufferer isn’t getting adequate basic nutritional needs met and struggles with eating consisting and adequately but the restriction and avoidant food behaviors are not INTENTIONAL but rather due to things such as sensory issues and is incredibly common among the neurodivergent community (ADHD/autism) people with this diagnosis also don’t usually struggle with body image pre-occupation with body piece that would characterize anorexia nervosa. It’s still valid and has same medical complications. An eating disorder is an eating disorder.   Intuitive eating dieticians helped me to heal my relationship with food and explore what my individual barriers to food are and how I can implement more variety into my diet and I was diagnosed with bulimia at 15 first treatment admission that was wrong and incorrect as I never engaged in the binge restrict cycle purely restriction with compensatory behaviors such as exercise chew and spit or purging. I was correctly diagnosed with anorexia nervosa purge subtype in 2019 during my third treatment admission which falls under EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) where they clump people who have EDs that don’t fall under strictly anorexia nor bulmia symptoms wise and engage in both or all behaviors or combo of behaviors from different ED diagnosis. It’s still disordered. Anything disordered is worthy of seeking help for and healing. The treatment for all eating disorders is the same: a team of intuitive eating dietician and therapist specializing in eating disorders is the current evidence based treatment. If you have other co-occurring mental health issues I highly recommend seeking a therapist to address everything and how they go hand in hand and influence one another.

"Your wife is lucky to have you supporting her!:) This could be for so many different reasons, im wondering why you dont want to ask your wife? Im coming from a restrictive ED perspective- what comes to mind is the urge to hoard food if the brain believes there is scarcity (i.e if its malnourished) which can be a common symptom of starvation. This could be a sign that she is restricting to some extent? Tabitha Farrar has some videos talking about hoarding in EDs. I think it normally goes away once eating is unrestricted - unless maybe there has been actual food scarcity in her past where food was not accessible, and this is a way to cope with the fear of not having enough food -Obviously I don’t know her history though. Or even for me now I worry if I don’t have food in the house then I won’t eat as much as I should and that can be a slippery slope, so maybe this is like a safety net for her in this way? This is all just speculating of course! As for supporting her, it really depends on the ‘why’ I think? Whether its a symptom of not eating enough or a way to cope otherwise, or avoid lapsing…?",EatingDisorders,positive,wife lucky supporting could many different reason im wondering dont want ask wife im coming restrictive ed perspective come mind urge hoard food brain belief scarcity ie malnourished common symptom starvation could sign restricting extent tabitha farrar video talking hoarding ed think normally go away eating unrestricted unless maybe actual food scarcity past food accessible way cope fear enough food obviously don ’ t know history though even worry don ’ t food house won ’ t eat much slippery slope maybe like safety net way speculating course supporting really depends ‘ why ’ think whether symptom eating enough way cope otherwise avoid lapsing…,SUBJECTIVE

I haven't had a proper friend for about 8 years, and even then it wasn't really that strong of a friendship.   My partner is in the same boat too and feels very sad when he sees close friendship portrayed on TV or whatever, and feels that deep pang of missing out on something seems to enrich your life.  I've tried to find clubs, groups, events etc but there's always something not quite right. They are either the wrong age group, or if they are about right, there's a certain air of match finding about them. Some are straight up money grabs, or connected to a business model.

"First of all it's great that you are getting therapy, kudos to you! I just found out at the age of 65 yrs that I am bi polar and am in therapy.   Second of all what I have found out through life when I am afraid to address an issue it gets bottled up inside my head, blown out of proportion because fear has taken over. Coming clean and opening up has brought much better results than when I let my mind twist it all into irrational delusional result.  Third. Your parents Love You and they do not want you to suffer. Most of the time parents react this way, from what I have learned in my life, is because they don't know how to react, what to do to help you so they get frustrated and irrational in their responses. My husband still has no understanding of what a panic attack is and why our adult children suffer from them. He doesn't understand intrusive thoughts that I suffer from. Though all of this is confusing to him he is jumping through hoops to help me and our children when they are having problems. We are his family and he loves us very much. The concept is the same whether your parents understand your problems or not. They would never let you harm yourself and certainly don't want you committing suicide!   Tell them you know they don't understand but you have a very serious mental condition that you are suffering tremendously from and you are scared, need their help. Open up to them about your fears. Have your therapist write up a report so you can show them. Tell them if it was possible to just brush it all off you would but unfortunately it's more than you can bear by yourself!   Are you on your parents insurance? If you are you can do in patient therapy hospital stay or out patient treatments. But it is imperative you tell them what is going on. If it's fear that is holding you back know that fear is just that. It cannot harm you  but can only make your life more miserable.

I looked like one of the crazies just fighting my mind like that, but that really is what it’s like. Usually a lot of time without a certain behaviour is what helps drive change. I don’t smoke now. I used to binge and purge compulsively and occasionally I’d purge, like I never truly stopped until almost 3 years ago now. Yeah, I think about it when I’m super full, but I never do it. And that physiological urge has disappeared entirely. I used to get very restless after eating and it would be hard to distract myself. Yeah, I think if I were still purging, I’d weigh less than I do now or even smoking since it curbs appetite. But I’m not doing any of those things and my life is better for it. Take supplements. It helps fight depression and impaired cognition.   There are absolutely ways that you can still get the kick of self starvation and remain healthy as ever. You don’t have to die. Your hair doesn’t have to fall out etc. You don’t actually have to make yourself sick. If that IS your desire, then you will put yourself through hell. Don’t do that to yourself. You don’t have to be afraid of food. Don’t low restrict too long otherwise you will be afraid to eat which will lower your quality of life and increase binge eating behaviours. You need to plan everything out meticulously and more importantly, you need to be flexible as to promote sustainability. It depends on what you suffer with. I’m prone to binge eating so there will be days I have to be flexible when I’d rather be inflexible because I know it will benefit me long term due to impulsive bingeing behaviours. It’s really about what your habits are and how you can perfect them if that’s what you want. If you just want quick, fast and easy weight loss, I’ve got bad news for you. Most people can’t achieve that, eating disorder or not and the mental impact is far worse.   Based on your post, it doesn’t seem that you’re in denial because of what you’ve just admitted. Isn’t that the first step? What is the endgoal for you? What is it that you want? Do you what you feel is going to help you thrive. I’m also not aware of stomach ulcers resulting from altered food intake.

"16-17 sounds like a good age to be diagnosed, young but it means things, sounds like you might have a good family involved. I had to seek out emergency mental healthcare at 26 on my own with no prospects or direction and the system pounced on that and I've been stuck ever since. Not to whine but my mom had her mom to help her financially; I've had nothing but disability cheques so nothing and no work experience of note. Nothing worthwhile.  Be eager to address your illness as once a good treatment and plan is sorted out you're good to go... sort of haha. But what I mean is you can focus on your goals, it's great that you want to be a teacher! Even if that isn't what you end up doing, expect to work for a living - absolutely tether yourself to that and make work... work for you. Success isn't in the destination, it is quite literally in the phrase SEIZE THE DAY. You'll have your ups and downs but as long as when you're well you take note of what it takes to survive successfully - WITTSS - and work to achieve that by itself I think it's definitely possible to live a worthwhile life. It might sound cheesy but your illness doesn't have to define you.  You sound a lot smarter than I was at your age - not even because you want to teach: but my dream at 16 was to be a screenwriter, not a very realistic path... for most people. Teach? At least you've been to a school, I've never been to Hollywood or met any famous actors.

"Here's a brief explanation of the difference between social anxiety and genuinely not wanting to socialize:
   
   Social Anxiety: This is a mental health condition where individuals experience excessive fear or anxiety in social situations. They may worry about being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated, leading to avoidance of social interactions. It's not about not wanting to socialize but rather feeling overwhelmed or distressed by the idea of socializing.
   
   Genuinely Not Wanting to Socialize: Some people simply prefer solitude or have introverted tendencies. They may enjoy their own company and find social interactions draining or unappealing. It's not driven by anxiety but rather personal preference or temperament.",socialanxiety,positive,here brief explanation difference social anxiety genuinely wanting socialize social anxiety mental health condition individual experience excessive fear anxiety social situation may worry judged embarrassed humiliated leading avoidance social interaction wanting socialize rather feeling overwhelmed distressed idea socializing genuinely wanting socialize people simply prefer solitude introverted tendency may enjoy company find social interaction draining unappealing driven anxiety rather personal preference temperament,SUBJECTIVE

"Your trauma defense system is what saved lives, yours and countless others.  But if you don’t clear your weapons system, the range is hot 24x7. And it can discharge without warning.  This gave me the permission to find and unload any live ordinance in my body rather than be ashamed I had them.    Treating Your Trauma Defensive System with Military Precision  Certainly! Here's an essay from the perspective of a 30-year ptsd veteran, drawing parallels between treating trauma's defensive system and maintaining a weapons system.   Treating Your Trauma Defensive System with Military Precision  In the heat of battle, a soldier relies on meticulously maintained weapon systems. These tools of defense and offense are a lifeline, a means of survival. The precision, care, and attention to detail that go into maintaining these systems is a matter of life and death. But there is another equally vital system that requires the same level of care and precision: the human mind's trauma defensive system.  I. The Defensive Mechanism of Trauma:  A Psychological Weapon  Just as a rifle or missile system can be deployed in a moment of crisis, so too can the human psyche activate its defensive mechanisms in response to trauma. This natural response helps individuals survive physically and emotionally taxing experiences. It serves to shield, protect, and, in some cases, help make split-second decisions that save lives.  However, like any weapon system, this defense mechanism can be misaligned, overly sensitive, or even dysfunctional if not properly maintained and understood. It may misfire at the wrong moment or become a burden instead of a boon.  II. Understanding and Respect: The Cornerstones of Care  In the military, understanding and respecting one's equipment is fundamental. The same principle applies to the trauma defensive system. This understanding begins with recognizing its existence and accepting its role as a protective measure. The respect stems from acknowledging its complexity and the delicacy required in handling it.   III. Maintenance and Calibration: A Delicate Process  The calibration of a weapons system ensures its precision and reliability. Similarly, the trauma defensive system needs proper tuning. This process involves careful observation, self-reflection, and, often, professional guidance.  Therapeutic approaches like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) are akin to the specialized tools used to calibrate and maintain weaponry. They provide the expertise needed to adjust, repair, or, if necessary, overhaul the defensive system.  IV. Continuous Vigilance: A Lifelong Commitment  In the military, weapon maintenance is a continuous process. It requires regular checks, updates, and adjustments. The same applies to the trauma defensive system. Healing from trauma is not a one-time fix but a lifelong commitment to mental well-being.  Regular mental health check-ups, self-awareness practices, and a strong support system are vital for ongoing maintenance. This proactive approach helps prevent the 'misfiring' of the defensive system, ensuring it remains an asset rather than becoming a liability.  V. Conclusion: A Holistic View of Defense  The parallels between maintaining a physical weapons system and a psychological trauma defensive system are striking and instructive. Both require precision, understanding, respect, continuous vigilance, and expert intervention.  As a 30-year PTSD veteran, I've learned that treating trauma's defensive system with the same rigor and attention to detail as any other weapon system is not only wise but essential. After all, the mind's defenses are among the most powerful tools at our disposal. In recognizing and nurturing this internal weaponry, we not only enhance our resilience but honor the profound complexity and capability of the human spirit.",ptsd,positive,trauma defense system saved life countless others don ’ t clear weapon system range hot 24x7 discharge without warning gave permission find unload live ordinance body rather ashamed treating trauma defensive system military precision certainly here essay perspective 30year ptsd veteran drawing parallel treating trauma defensive system maintaining weapon system treating trauma defensive system military precision heat battle soldier relies meticulously maintained weapon system tool defense offense lifeline mean survival precision care attention detail go maintaining system matter life death another equally vital system requires level care precision human mind trauma defensive system defensive mechanism trauma psychological weapon rifle missile system deployed moment crisis human psyche activate defensive mechanism response trauma natural response help individual survive physically emotionally taxing experience serf shield protect case help make splitsecond decision save life however like weapon system defense mechanism misaligned overly sensitive even dysfunctional properly maintained understood may misfire wrong moment become burden instead boon ii understanding respect cornerstone care military understanding respecting one equipment fundamental principle applies trauma defensive system understanding begin recognizing existence accepting role protective measure respect stem acknowledging complexity delicacy required handling iii maintenance calibration delicate process calibration weapon system ensures precision reliability similarly trauma defensive system need proper tuning process involves careful observation selfreflection often professional guidance therapeutic approach like cognitivebehavioral therapy cbt eye movement desensitization reprocessing emdr akin specialized tool used calibrate maintain weaponry provide expertise needed adjust repair necessary overhaul defensive system iv continuous vigilance lifelong commitment military weapon maintenance continuous process requires regular check update adjustment applies trauma defensive system healing trauma onetime fix lifelong commitment mental wellbeing regular mental health checkup selfawareness practice strong support system vital ongoing maintenance proactive approach help prevent misfiring defensive system ensuring remains asset rather becoming liability v conclusion holistic view defense parallel maintaining physical weapon system psychological trauma defensive system striking instructive require precision understanding respect continuous vigilance expert intervention 30year ptsd veteran ive learned treating trauma defensive system rigor attention detail weapon system wise essential mind defense among powerful tool disposal recognizing nurturing internal weaponry enhance resilience honor profound complexity capability human spirit,SUBJECTIVE

"That was EXACTLY me at your age, at 24 I was still in college getting straight A's, never had a girlfriend I actually liked, never had sex.  Felt like a failure cuz I didn't fit in or behave like the cool kids.  Always felt rejected, seen as the outsider, seen as weird for trying to fit in whenever I tried but failed.  Years later I realized none of that 'fitting in' stuff even matters.  I realized I probably just have Aspergers/Autism and this is simply who I am.  I fit in with other people on the spectrum and life is a blast.  I will forever be seen as weird by the neurotypical crowd because I don't do similar social things that they do, but that doesnt matter to me when I have neurodivergent friends who accept me for who I am.  Even if you aren't on the spectrum, try making friends with neurodivergent people, you'll realize that 'socializing' as neurotypicals define it doesn't matter at all.

"This definitely sounds like you’re heading towards a relapse. These things may not be problematic for the typical person and heck may sound within the ‘normal’ culture of things, but for those of us with eating disorder genes, this ‘normal’ is not okay. You are trying to suppress your body weight. I dont know if you know the ED coach Tabitha Farrar? Id recommend looking at her blogs. She reckons that relapses can appear ‘justified’ and not like a relapse because the behaviours can be disguised as ‘being healthy’. Once a behaviour is started, it tends to activate someones whole ED neural network and memories of other eating disorder behaviours - and thats why its a very slippery slope. Doing those behaviours is linked with a whole lot of other shit for those of us with EDs, probs not for the normal person though. So if you’re doing these things, I would be very surprised if your ED didn’t creep back into your life. Any attempts to control your weight is taking away from listening to your body, and any attempts to suppress your weight is reinforcing a fear of weight/fat that underlies an ED. You are essentially teaching your brain, through your actions, that weight gain is bad, of course that can be problematic. Im sorry you’re experiencing this, my advice is to let all control go back to your body.

"This was me at a point in my life. Friends are meant to come and go in your life! You need to find a way to reach out to one of them (as painful as it might be) and ask them why they abandoned you . I think once you get your closure, you can finally let go and heal.    I noticed that friends  even family always abandoned me. I was never good enough. I felt cursed and blamed myself. Until one day, a psychic randomly approached me in public and gave a reading on the spot. She picked up so much pain and suffering from me which is why she stopped me. She said “ you have ALOT of jealously around you”. And even though you have people around you, you still feel very lonely. I said me?? What’s there to be jealous of?? She said I don’t know, maybe the way you carry yourself, the way your life is going…. I understood instantly. From the outside I appear to be confident, opinionated, outgoing, fashionable… on the inside, I’m feel opposite. And she was spot on about the loneliness.   What I’m trying to say is people are very insecure in themselves and if there’s anything about you, anything you have that they don’t. They tend to project those insecurities on you and take it out on you which makes you feel like a terrible person.   Since that reading, I’ve payed attention to the people that have abandoned me and yes I can see why I or my life would make them Jealous.   People do all sorts of weird things out of jealousy. Sometimes it’s hard to  connect the dots.  But in my case I was able to use that to heal and move on.

"This is called Passive Suicidal Ideation in the literature (PSI)   It explains as someone who doesn't really have plans or intentions to end their life but also has mixed feelings about being alive. For them having or losing their life doesn't have any significant meaning. Also for some reason, maybe a bus hits them on their way to some routine task that they're already been bored even though it's seen as important or delightful from an outer perspective and die, they wouldn't mind that  Maybe they'd even see it as a relief.   If you were to go deeper in this subject, it might help you understand your position, it wouldn't necessarily pull you out but it'd certainly help you understand where exactly youre standing in the dark, you might find it easier or/and clearer where your next step should hit, since you would have a better understanding about your position.   Oh and about thriving, please mind that us humans are ""habit forming creatures"". It is a surviving mechanism that basically let's you do the things you're best at without thinking about them, like riding a bicycle or driving a car or writing anything. All of these tasks you do not think or strategise about them, you're able to ""just"" do it. Reason is they've become habits.   To go further, after a habit is formed you do actually forget about them, this mechanism lets you detect what you dont have very rapidly, so you can focus on what skill you don't have to survive and be busy about that.   What I'm saying is, it is most likely that you have already made a habit about what you, as an individual are the best at and forget about it. You already made a habit out of what you would thrive from/with.   All because of our very intellectual but still owned by a confused and scared primate brain. Maybe you could read more about ""habit forming creatures"". And maybe it'd let you rediscover your, let's just say thriving units.   And lastly, you may be feeling alienated from your immediate social circle. It is understandable too. Just please take notice that, I- a stranger just did took my time and energy to interact with you, English is also not my mother tongue so this took more energy and time than it looks.

"Having people say triggering things definitely makes it harder, that's really understandable. I personally would try to politely ask her that you are not comfortable with her talking about eating/food that much. You don't owe her any explanation whatsoever. I think keeping the topic very broad and general when talking to her about it could help make the conversation easier. For example you could say something like: ""I'm sure you don't have any bad intentions, but I'm not really comfortable with talking about eating/food that often. I'd love to talk more about [insert any random topic you like to talk about] tho!""   I don't know if that makes sense, but by mentioning it ""casually"" and stating that you don't blame her for mentioning it, it should be easier for both of you, I guess.   And yes, you are responsible for your recovery, but it's also totally okay to ask for adjustments from your surroundings from time to time :) Especially since she's specifically made comments about your looks/ wanting to look like you etc. I personally think that's really insensitive and disrespectful, so simply asking her to stop doing that is definitely your right!

"Honestly thank you so much for making this post. This is something I've been suffering with for years now and I have seen hardly any posts about it. This head shaking symptom has hands down ruined my life. I can't be around anyone without my head vibrating and shaking. I thought it was just me experiencing this so I never got help for it. What I would do instead is, in an attempt to stop my head shaking, I always tensed up my neck and head like a rock so it wouldn't shake. Years of doing this has meant unfortunately I now have severe chronic neck pain and tension due to this, can't go anywhere without taking pain killers, am in 24/7 pain and can barely get out of bed in the morning, and my head is literally banking to the right as the muscles are pulling it down so I look crippled. Every time I go out in public my neck will automatically tense up to try and stop the head shake. It's absolutely debilitating and it means when I'm near people I freeze up like a frickin statue and I can't move myself or my head will start vibrating. Even if I let loose for one second and start doing some breathing, my head will vibrate and shake,  If I didn't have this head shaking symptom I'm sure my social anxiety would be like 90% gone as this is what's fuelling it: I fear people will notice my head shake, therefore making me very self conscious and making the head shake more. I've done so much work mentally and I am doing well. I tell myself nobody is judging me and I am safe in the presence of others, but however hard I try my head continues to shake whenever people look at me. It's killing me and it's preventing me from furthering my career, making friends and getting a partner. It kills me how others can sit in front of me and relax, move about and do whatever they want, whereas I have to be like a rock unable to move and looking crippled and strange because if I let loose then my head will shake.  I'm now on my journey of trying to beat this and I've tried everything on your list. What has helped me the most is the meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, not skipping meals and making sure I go out with a full stomach, going to therapy, doing exposure (but not too much exposure as I ended up overdoing myself and causing this chronic pain) and doing a big cardio workout before going out anywhere. I'm also going to try propranolol again as I used it but it didn't work, probably as I didn't combine it with any other techniques like the breathing you mentioned so I'll give it a try!  Unfortunately my head still shakes severely but I'm confident with time and effort this won't be forever. I admire how much you have tried and how far you have come, thanks for the post and for making me feel less alone in this.

"With the effects of schizophrenia, this is absolutely true and most likely the case.  As someone with schizoaffective even that's been hard, when it first came out (and psychotic episodes) I had a lot of delusions mostly based on some wacky psychedelic experiences and some beliefs. I was constantly in my head and distracted by the effects and my thoughts. I fell further into this and literally rewired by brain to have different and specific thinking/behavioral habits/patterns. Literally lost my mind. Specifically anxiety and depersonalization was at that uncurable point and I was worse off than anybody I had ever known.  When I realized, It was a long way to unravel all that and get better. I had so many fear responses, intrusive thoughts, hallucinations, and questioned parts of reality. I'm happy to say now I have control over hallucinations and only struggle with anxiety and some depersonalization. Massive difference. Due to hard work i know I'll still get better from here.  Point is, having full on schizophrenia can be a WHOLE lot worse, and therefore (especially in young ages or those new to the experience) it's very likely you'd have delusions. Doesn't mean you cant work on mentality or get better from it, but it takes like years of time and is one of the most mentally draining experiences.",schizophrenia,positive,effect schizophrenia absolutely true likely case someone schizoaffective even thats hard first came psychotic episode lot delusion mostly based wacky psychedelic experience belief constantly head distracted effect thought fell literally rewired brain different specific thinkingbehavioral habitspatterns literally lost mind specifically anxiety depersonalization uncurable point worse anybody ever known realized long way unravel get better many fear response intrusive thought hallucination questioned part reality im happy say control hallucination struggle anxiety depersonalization massive difference due hard work know ill still get better point full schizophrenia whole lot worse therefore especially young age new experience likely youd delusion doesnt mean cant work mentality get better take like year time one mentally draining experience,SUBJECTIVE
"Maybe people think that in DID you can hear your alters talk to each other, or think that in schizophrenia all the voices you hear are parts of your personality. DID is a dissociative disorder that can cause inner confusion/turmoil, and schizophrenia is (partly) a ""confusion disorder"" that can cause dissociative symptoms. Just ask someone with disorganized thoughts like me what it's like, they'll likely tell you there's a constant level of at least mild confusion all the time, a little bit of DPDR that keeps you on your toes and makes it hard to do normal person things.   Some of my first auditory hallucinations were different emotions talking to each other, they would argue all day every day, but the difference is that none of them ever ""took over"" my mind like they might in severe cases of DID. I could hear them and interact with them but they were not alters, they were parts of a whole.  Lastly, dissociative disorders like DID and psychotic disorders like schizophrenia can both be triggered by intense psychological or physical trauma. There's also something to be said about having multiple personalities that you may or may not remember being - it could be seen as losing touch with reality. Delusional in a way. However the underlying cause for schizophrenic delusions has to do with wiring and chemicals that misbehave in a totally different way than in DID even though some symptoms might appear similar on the surface.  So yeah schizophrenia indeed does not cause multiple personalities, but hearing parts of your personality talking to each other can come across as a bit multiple personality-ish and someone who completely changes behavior and might not even remember what happened as a little bit delusional to some. It's important not to get these two disorders mixed up since treatment is so different, but I don't fault people who do mix them up.",schizophrenia,negative,maybe people think hear alters talk think schizophrenia voice hear part personality dissociative disorder cause inner confusionturmoil schizophrenia partly confusion disorder cause dissociative symptom ask someone disorganized thought like like theyll likely tell there constant level least mild confusion time little bit dpdr keep toe make hard normal person thing first auditory hallucination different emotion talking would argue day every day difference none ever took mind like might severe case could hear interact alters part whole lastly dissociative disorder like psychotic disorder like schizophrenia triggered intense psychological physical trauma there also something said multiple personality may may remember could seen losing touch reality delusional way however underlying cause schizophrenic delusion wiring chemical misbehave totally different way even though symptom might appear similar surface yeah schizophrenia indeed cause multiple personality hearing part personality talking come across bit multiple personalityish someone completely change behavior might even remember happened little bit delusional important get two disorder mixed since treatment different dont fault people mix,SUBJECTIVE

"I had abscesses under my gums as a 4 year old and the dentist would cut into my gums while I screamed and cried. The novocaine didn’t completely numb the pain. I had a lot of digestion and allergy problems as a child because I had undiagnosed food sensitivities. I used to get horrible constipation and diarrhea as a child. My eyes would swell shut and I couldn’t breathe through my nose very often.   When I was 7, I broke my leg at school in a fight. Turned out I had a bone cyst in my femur and that’s why it broke. First doctor committed malpractice and just kept me in a body cast (waist down) for 6 weeks without treating the cyst. I had problems bed wetting as a child (turns out it’s common when being physically abused and neglected as I was) and I remember how awful the cast smelled after 6 weeks.   I ended up needing surgery on my femur to eliminate the cyst. I was 7. I remember my dream during surgery was of a monster chasing me. Then I woke up in the recovery room and projectile vomited across the room.   It took 2 years of physical therapy before I could run again. I forgot how to run during my leg troubles. My right leg was shorter than my left. I still have a curve in my spine. I was a foot shorter than everyone else in my class and the only minority so you can imagine how socially uncomfortable I felt for most of my childhood.   Throughout, I continued to have bad allergies and terrible stomach pain. My mom was desperate and subjected me to quack treatments. The worst was when I was 10. I was told to expose myself to allergens and then pee in a cup. That urine was re-injected into my body through a big needle into my butt. I hated that treatment and it didn’t work. Wtf mom. Really? I think around couple of years after this I learned from her diary (I snooped, sorry mom) that when I was born, my dad was so resentful that he would not let my mom feed or clean me when she brought me home. Their neighbors had to intervene. Great start to life!  Fast forward a couple of decades of continued poor health (all the while dealing with undiagnosed PTSD, ADHD, misophonia and food sensitivities and lots of medical gaslighting) and during COVID, I came down with an anal abscess, anal fissure and then an anal fistula. The worst 3 years of my life. My partner wasn’t supportive and actually rolled her eyes whenever I tried to talk about what I’d learned about food sensitivities, PTSD, misophonia, etc. She would shush me when I tried to talk about my abscess/fissure/fistula because she found it disgusting. I felt so alone.   Fortunately, all of the awfulness led to me work on myself and really learn to love myself. I changed my diet, my habits, my behavior and appearance. I’m almost completely recovered now, I’ve changed a lot and learned how to be physically, mentally and emotionally healthy for the first time in my life. I’m getting a divorce. I feel very grateful that all the awfulness has led to this point 🙏  But I still distrust doctors because the quality of care that I received for my anal fistula was awful. And I faced so much gaslighting as I tried to figure out which foods caused health issues for me.

"Depression can definitely be a chemical imbalance, but when it's not, it helps to find out what deep causes are making you depressed.   The trick is that sometimes the causes are least where you expect them, or they are things you cannot change from within yourself.   Several years ago I would have told you I was still deeply in love with my husband, even though we were separated, his every communication with me was like a glimmer of light in the darkness. Even though he was already living with a coworker, I guess I held out hope that he didn't want a divorce and wanted to stay married.   I finally just had to understand that that was a financial decision on his part. As soon as I said I needed space and to not physically see him anymore, as it was always like seeing an oasis I could not swim hard enough to reach, he promptly introduced his girlfriend to his family and forgot about me. Like dropped me hard. The last thing he was afraid of was that his family would find out he'd been having an affair. But now that fear doesn't exist anymore, and in his life, neither do I.

"Hi, first of all, I'm very sorry you're going through this. You sound like a very responsible and hardworking student, and you don't deserve this.   I suffer a similar situation sometimes. For me, it's not a specific voice of someone I know, so I'm unsure if this would work for you, but I wanted to share it in case it helps. I was recommended by my therapist to address the person/voice/feeling. I was hesitant at first because it sounds a bit crazy, but it does work. Basically, for example, you would address your mother's voice. She says that you're not good enough? You answer, ""You're wrong, I know I'm good.""... you get the idea.

"First, try just doing something relaxing, like a bath, yoga, whatever relaxes you.  Take yourself out of your stressful area/situation.  When you get back to your best area to study, try doing things that can make it less overwhelming, like cleaning off your desk, getting all your studying materials organized and within reaching distance.  Reduce as many obstacles as possible.  Set up relaxing things, like lavender scented candles, or whatever brings you peace.  Eat some food, watch TV or whatever for a little bit if you need to, and then spend 15 minutes on your studying.  Instead of actually studying, just plan out everything that you'll need to study for in the order that you want to do it in.  Once you have it all mapped out, you're done for the day.  Just focus on your physical and mental health so you can be in a better place tomorrow.  Tomorrow (morning, maybe an hour after waking?), get into a good head space again, bath, light candles, eat something, all that.  Then dedicate 30 minutes to studying as you planned the day before.  It can take time for your brain to switch activities and properly focus, so you may not be fully in study mode during that 30 minutes, that's okay.  The point is to just start the process of studying so that it feels less daunting.  You may even find yourself going past the 30 minutes anyway, because you realize it isn't so bad.  After you're done studying, go do whatever to feel good again, go about your day, and think about trying again in the afternoon.  Maybe instead of 30, try 45 or an hour.  Continue this the following day, slowly increasing your time spent studying.    You're smart and young, things will work out for you in your academics.  This final isn't the end of the world, there will be more tests, there is always more time, and even if you fail miserably, you can just try again next year or whatever.  Your life does not depend on this exam.  I would avoid over doing anti-depressants (does that even make you feel better?).  You may have unwanted side-effects like anxiety.

It’s really tough and if someone hasn’t faced it, they will NEVER understand(trust me, I’ve tried explaining).   The first thing I would say is that don’t pay attention to people who devalue what you are going through. You are going through a difficult time and there is nothing to be ashamed of in that, no matter your age. Don’t let people say “You shouldn’t feel this way, etc.” bcz they really don’t know what you are actually going through. You need to treat your body kindly and try your best to let it heal. Treat depression as a sickness because it is. Don’t fight it but try to embrace it and live with it till you get better.   I’m also struggling with tiredness A LOT. I can barely do any of the things I used to, despite them being so “easy”. I also feel like I don’t really belong in this world.

"There is almost no such thing as a perfectly good person or a perfectly wicked person. Nearly everyone has a mix of virtues and vices within them. Trying to categorise yourself in a binary way as ""good"" or ""evil"" will not lead to an accurate self-understanding.  If you can accept that you have this mix of good and evil, it will help because it will free you from two opposite errors. Someone who mistakenly thinks they are completely good becomes complacent and does not recognise or resist their vice, and someone who mistakenly thinks they are completely evil despairs because they see no reason for hope and no way of growing in virtue.   Also, it's important to recognise the difference between being tempted to do something evil and actually co-operating with that temptation. Being tempted is not something you can be blamed for, because you have no choice about what tempts you. It is how you chose to react to that temptation that matters more. If you recognise the temptation as wrong, if it troubles you and you fight against it, not even wanting to allow space in your mind, then that is a sign that there is still some meaningful good within you.  (NB - I've restricted myself to talking about moral issues here, because that's what your question is mostly asking about. I've deliberately avoided anything about mental health per se, as as I don't feel I can make any accurate judgements about that side of things).",mentalhealth,positive,almost thing perfectly good person perfectly wicked person nearly everyone mix virtue vice within trying categorise binary way good evil lead accurate selfunderstanding accept mix good evil help free two opposite error someone mistakenly think completely good becomes complacent recognise resist vice someone mistakenly think completely evil despair see reason hope way growing virtue also important recognise difference tempted something evil actually cooperating temptation tempted something blamed choice tempts chose react temptation matter recognise temptation wrong trouble fight even wanting allow space mind sign still meaningful good within nb ive restricted talking moral issue thats question mostly asking ive deliberately avoided anything mental health per se dont feel make accurate judgement side thing,SUBJECTIVE

Mania isn't just feeling okay, or good, it's more like feeling like you can do anything (sometimes, literally anything).

If your good days feel more like you're just content in life, maybe even a little positive and happy, that does not sound like mania.

"I’m so sorry that this is where your head is at. I can understand where you’re coming from. I had a major psychotic break a little over a year ago. Ended up in the hospital. I’m still technically not able to live on my own… Psychosis is nothing to mess with. It’s unfortunate that we have this spicy brain that likes to tell and show us things that aren’t grounded in this reality. I fight with my psychosis.. Which is probably not the right thing to do. But I’m like “I’m throwing hands now! You’re not going to win!” I think that if your brain is going to start giving you a script, try and change it, I know.. I know.. I sound crazy. Well, I am. Just how if you take shrooms and you start to have a bad trip, you just change your surroundings, grab someone’s hand that you trust, and tell yourself that you’re on drugs. Honestly, I met God, I don’t fear death anymore. And because of that, I’m able to love and live life a lot happier than I was. Don’t get me wrong. I have my moments, and I did have another episode a few months ago. And I was kindaaaa able to pull myself out of it. It’s a long story though. And then I fell into a month long depression.

I would always try to avoid them and getting a job because I knew the amount of anxiety it would bring.   Last year I gave myself a kick up the arse and got my driving license, job, car and now I'm moving out in a few weeks. The reason why I made all this happen was because I was living exactly how you are now. But I couldn't bear it anymore. I was ashamed of my life and it caused me so much anxiety and depression because of what everyone thought of me. I had to force myself through a lot of anxious situations. Even now, working full time is causing me so much anxiety but i just have to keep forcing myself through it till one day I can hopefully find the perfect job that suits me.

"I’ve found that anxiety is almost always a sign of hunger. And that hunger significantly increases anxiety. And eating significantly decreases it (after some time of recovery).  Anxiety causes your body to summon all the blood sugar/carbs it has so you can escape from the predator or think well for a test. If you don’t have much carb supply/blood sugar/food in general your body will ask for it by your stomach hurting or buy you feeling shaky or clammy or anxious.   It’s hard to calm your stomach enough to eat, but that’s what you need to do. Start with maybe fruit juice or a smoothie or a lollipop. Anything to get some sugar in your system so you can stop running on your own muscle mass.  Eventually assuming you’ve been under eating, you’ll likely have a period of extreme hunger. It’s important to honor it. If you don’t, your life is on hold. (It might be 10000 calories per day but don’t freak out — it’s normal!)  Recovery is a hard journey but if you choose it you will be greatly rewarded in health.

"Just from my experience--it's very, very difficult. If the person in question is experiencing delusions as though they were real, you have to understand that their reality, though it differs greatly from the one you observe, is none the less real *to them*. It would be like trying to convince someone asleep in a nightmare that the nightmare is just a nightmare. While you're *in* the nightmare, it's real. The difference being that people suffering from schizophrenia don't really ""wake up"". The other analogy I've come up with from my anecdotal experience is that it's like the person you used to know has been hijacked by an alien organism. That organism wants to stay in control of the host they've invaded. So trying to convince them that they need medication and therapy is akin to rooting out the organism that's hijacked the person you know. They don't want to leave and they'll defend themselves with the very convincing delusion that your attempt to help your friend is a fiendish attack.   &#x200B;  In other words, trying to convince someone that their madness is real is so hard because, well, they're mad. So straight rationality isn't something they deal well with.  &#x200B;  My thought here is to always tell them the truth as you know it as gently as you can. You don't have to disagree with them or get mad at their refusal to accept a reality you see so well but you also don't have to back off what you know to be true.",schizophrenia,negative,experienceits difficult person question experiencing delusion though real understand reality though differs greatly one observe none le real would like trying convince someone asleep nightmare nightmare nightmare youre nightmare real difference people suffering schizophrenia dont really wake analogy ive come anecdotal experience like person used know hijacked alien organism organism want stay control host theyve invaded trying convince need medication therapy akin rooting organism thats hijacked person know dont want leave theyll defend convincing delusion attempt help friend fiendish attack x200b word trying convince someone madness real hard well theyre mad straight rationality isnt something deal well x200b thought always tell truth know gently dont disagree get mad refusal accept reality see well also dont back know true,SUBJECTIVE

"The brain doesn't know what is real to some extent. That's why virtual reality glasses scare the living hell out of people when they see they are on a roller coaster ride. Obviously they aren't. They are in their living room. Safe. But the brain doesn't know that. The same applies for words. Your tongue holds the power of life and death. We know this to be true as anytime someone has said something harsh, you feel it in your core, yet when someone says something positive, you feel it in your core and feel a sense of well-being and love.  This can and does occur with ourself.  But you have to look at ""How"" you have trained it before you can train it differently.  If you tell yourself "" I am worthless, I can't change, I hate myself"" Your brain responds with. ""Okay, sure."" and what shows up in your life is exactly that. Low self-worth, struggle to change, a loathing for yourself.  But the beauty is, that does not need to be YOUR permanent story.  Begin to change the words you speak over yourself even if it feels awkward. (I am safe, I am well, I am capable. I am confident. I am kind. I am friendly. I am... fill in the blank.""  Remember, this is not positive talk for the sake of it. You are rewiring your brain to respond and react with an outcome that is better than the one you have held.  Also understand that ""Thoughts"" come and go like clouds, like weather.  To experience the good, you must also be willing to experience the days when its cloudy.  It doesn't mean you are less than on the cloud days.  Maybe this will help. Look at a monitor that checks your heart. It goes up and down, to indicate ""you are alive"". It's only when its flatlined that you are dead. ( neither high nor low)  In life, we cannot appreciate the views to be found if we stay in the valley, we must ascend the peak, ( that takes time, effort, a will)  But also, we must realize, we cannot stay there. We must eventually descend back into the valley and live.You breath out, you breath in. Clouds come, clouds go. Nature grows, nature dies. The sun rises, the sun sets. This is the natural cycle of life. Humans are no different.  You have access to a palate of emotions and a canvas. You can choose to dip into a dark color, or a light color. You can even convince yourself that there are only dark colors if you want to paint a picture that is dark.  But no human wants to remain in that, and that's why they reach out for help online, over a phone, or in person. When you recognize that ""moments"" only last for a ""period of time"", you recognize they don't have as much power over you.  Do you fear the days when its not sunny? No because you know those gray skies won't last. You know you dont have to sit there staring at it, checking your clock for when they will pass. Eventually they will.  The state of a day doesn't have to control the way you are and how you interact with the world.  You are not depression.  You are not happiness.  You are the thing behind all of that.  You can observe it for what it is, interact with it, if you wish, but realize that your freedom is one thought away, one action away.

"Hello OP, I personnaly find chatGPT is good in providing script for difficult conversation. For your situation, this is what chatGPT said and I agreed with every points personnaly :   Navigating a relationship where mental health challenges like borderline personality disorder (BPD) and symptoms such as delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations are present can be incredibly challenging, especially at a young age. It's commendable that you're seeking to support your girlfriend and looking for ways to effectively help her through her episodes. Here are some suggestions on how you might approach these situations:  # Understanding and Patience  * **Empathize**: Recognize that what she's experiencing feels very real to her, even if it doesn't align with reality. Your empathy and understanding can be comforting.  # Communication  * **Validating Feelings**: Instead of challenging her perceptions directly, acknowledge her feelings. You might say, ""I see that this is really scary for you,"" rather than immediately trying to correct her reality. * **Calm Reassurance**: If she perceives you as a threat due to her hallucinations, maintain a calm demeanor and reassure her of your identity and your intentions. You can say, ""I know you're feeling scared right now, and it's okay. I'm here to support you, not to hurt you.""  # Safety  * **Ensure Safety**: Your primary concern should be the safety of both of you. If at any point you feel that she might harm herself or others, it's crucial to seek help from a trusted adult or professional.  # Support  * **Encourage Professional Help**: While supporting her emotionally, encourage her to seek help from mental health professionals who can provide appropriate treatment and support. * **Seek Support for Yourself**: Supporting someone with mental health challenges can be taxing. It's important for you to have support too, whether it's from trusted adults, friends, or professional counselors.  # Limitations  * **Recognize Your Limits**: You mentioned that you're only 14 and not an expert, which is a very mature realization. It's important to understand that there are limits to how much you can help and that professional intervention is often necessary.  # Educate Yourself  * **Learn About Her Conditions**: Educating yourself about BPD and related symptoms can help you understand what she's going through and how best to support her. There are many resources online and books available that can provide valuable insights.  # Crisis Plan  * **Have a Plan**: It might be helpful to discuss a plan with her for when she's experiencing severe episodes. This plan could include safe words, actions to take, and who to call for help.  Remember, while supporting your girlfriend is important, your well-being is equally important. Balancing your desire to help with taking care of your own health and well-being is crucial. It might also be beneficial for you to talk to a counselor or therapist about your experiences and feelings. They can offer you support and guidance on how to navigate these challenges while also taking care of yourself.",schizophrenia,positive,hello op personnaly find chatgpt good providing script difficult conversation situation chatgpt said agreed every point personnaly navigating relationship mental health challenge like borderline personality disorder bpd symptom delusion paranoia hallucination present incredibly challenging especially young age commendable youre seeking support girlfriend looking way effectively help episode suggestion might approach situation understanding patience empathize recognize shes experiencing feel real even doesnt align reality empathy understanding comforting communication validating feeling instead challenging perception directly acknowledge feeling might say see really scary rather immediately trying correct reality calm reassurance perceives threat due hallucination maintain calm demeanor reassure identity intention say know youre feeling scared right okay im support hurt safety ensure safety primary concern safety point feel might harm others crucial seek help trusted adult professional support encourage professional help supporting emotionally encourage seek help mental health professional provide appropriate treatment support seek support supporting someone mental health challenge taxing important support whether trusted adult friend professional counselor limitation recognize limit mentioned youre 14 expert mature realization important understand limit much help professional intervention often necessary educate learn condition educating bpd related symptom help understand shes going best support many resource online book available provide valuable insight crisis plan plan might helpful discus plan shes experiencing severe episode plan could include safe word action take call help remember supporting girlfriend important wellbeing equally important balancing desire help taking care health wellbeing crucial might also beneficial talk counselor therapist experience feeling offer support guidance navigate challenge also taking care,SUBJECTIVE

The last 5 hospitalizations occurred between March and Thanksgiving 2023. Last year, medication only seemed to work for a short while (maybe a month to 3 months) before it needed to be exchanged for another one. The medications I’ve been on since early November seem to work fairly well. They are great at preventing psychosis but not the best for depression. I was kicked off my parent’s insurance at of January 1st because I turned 26 last year. Right now I’m going to a free (or close to free) mental health clinic in my city. I’m trying to gradually tweak the medication to help with my depression. The past couple of months, I’ve rarely left the house. I rarely even sit on my back porch. I’ve been bathing every 2 or 3 days. I’m working on turning that around.   Today, I finally washed my clothes and am going to shower. I’m thankful I’ve developed a high level of self awareness in the past few years. It’s high for a schizophrenic person anyway. I’ve learned what my symptoms look like and what it feels like when I’m headed to psychosis. It’s never a sudden development for me. There are usually signs a couple of months in advance. I realized I can accomplish anything if I refuse to negotiate with myself. When I constantly allow myself to change my mind and back out of challenging situations I never accomplish anything. After I change my mind or flake or give up I beat myself up about it.   I read the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen the other day. I read it in 6th grade but as an adult I have a completely different viewpoint. It really showed me the power of a positive attitude and solution-oriented mindset. Yes, I’m facing difficulties but I can make use of the resources I have to make the situation better.   Sorry I’m kind of off topic. For a long time I felt cursed by my diagnosis. I’ve dropped out of 3 colleges and have less than a semester’s worth of credits. I’ve had to take medical leave at every job I’ve had because of my mental health. I felt even worse because I’ve never done drugs or had a drop of alcohol. All the other schizophrenic and schizophrenic-adjacent people were addicts or recovering addicts.   I’ve applied for disability and according to my case manager I’ve been pretty much approved. It still will be a few months until all the paperwork is completed. I applied for disability once before. It’s going much better this time around.   To answer your questions more directly. Medication is paramount. Talk therapy is a close second. Without therapy (individual or group) I wouldn’t know how to manage my symptoms or take steps to prevent them. I haven’t found one style of therapy to work well on its own. I like therapy that isn’t just DBT worksheets with their poorly formulated acronyms. I like CBT as a general framework but I rather have an open forum  in group therapy.

"I was actually in a very similar situation when I was your age. Went to college at 18, and by the time I turned 19 I dropped out... Or really, I flunked out. To say I was devastated would be an understatement. Honestly, I had been dealing with anxiety and depression for quite some time, though I had only gotten diagnosed when I started struggling immediately after getting into university. But flunking out was hard. I already felt like I was undeserving of the love and attention my family gave me. Their unconditional support overwhelmed me, and what should have been something to give me the strength to press on was distorted by my mental illnesses into a weapon. So when I flunked out, I thought that was the end for me. That now, my life had no meaning, and that I deserved the worst. I would be lying if I said the thought of ending it all never came to mind.   But I didn't. I went ahead and got therapy, something that I had been begging for, but couldn't get. And it helped me a lot. Now I'm 24, in community college about to get my associates. Is it as good as a bachelor's to society? No, but it sure as hell is great to me!   Life... Is rough. Really rough. I'm not struggling with everything you are. You have your own circumstances just as I have mine. That being said, where you are isn't the end. It doesn't have to be. I can't guarantee that everything will be fixed by tomorrow or within the next 6 months. But it isn't the end. You just need to keep going forward. And that doesn't mean going to university or community college. Like someone said, there are plenty of careers that don't require a degree.   All you need to do right now is take one step forward. I hope this helps ❤️❤️  I hope you have a good night and a better tomorrow and days and weeks and months and years after. I hope the best for you.

"Seems like your mother is projecting on you, the whole drugs thing seems suspicious and i could be that she took drugs herself or doing it right now. She definitely needs some professional help, but i don't think she really wants to do so, since that's usually the case. If your mother did take drugs at some point she could've had a ""bad trip"" (idk the medical terms I'm sorry) and that can sometimes lead to enhancing schizophrenia (usually you have it in the first place and when dealt with something bad while being on drugs it can get really bad). Idk if she'll agree to any of these things but i would make her take a drug test because these things seem rlly suspicious, and get professional help that can diagnose her problems. But in all honesty this shouldn't be all your probelm, it seems like she's been mentally abusing you in your childhood and still wanting control over your life because she doesn't have control over her own, i don't know if you want to but I'd cut her off or/and get her professional help.

"I would say emotional eating for sure. Disordered eating, yes. An eating disorder, maybe? The diagnosis isn’t the important part. If the way you feel is connected to what/how much you do/don’t eat, that’s a sign that you are using food to “treat, mask, assuage” the feelings you are avoiding. Usually feelings that are uncomfortable…sad, lonely, depressed, anxious, betrayed, etc.   I would suggest paying attention to foods that taste good to you or are providing nutrients for your body! When you don’t eat often, you are less likely to notice hunger cues. However, not eating all day and then binging or eating a large amount of food is very common. When your body goes into starvation mode, then you have the urge to eat as much as you can because your body doesn’t know when you will feed it again. It might be helpful to even try eating a couple snacks during the day regardless of whether you re hungry. This is because you know that not eating leads to over-indulgence. It’s completely normal to be tempted or want something more when it isn’t available or you aren’t allowing yourself to have it. Eating something throughout the day will help stabilize your blood sugar and likely decrease the obsessive thoughts.  I definitely don’t have all the answers! This is based on my opinion, experience, and psychology/nutritional information I have learned. I would be happy to listen or read more about what you are thinking and how you are feeling! I also have a plethora of resources and ideas if you are interested in more. Let me know if I can help or support you! Keep reaching out!

"Going to therapy might help with developing coping strategies. There's psychologists who specialize in psychosis, and there's therapeutic methods, like CBT, ACT, and DBT, that have been adapted for psychosis. Sometimes it's best to do a multidisciplinary approach, not just medication.   Here's therapy directories you might be able to utilize, and if there's not many options in your area, he can try doing remote therapy where location doesn't matter.  https://schizophreniaresource.wordpress.com/resources/#therapy  Here's also some diverse therapeutic workshop series for psychosis being held by the International Society for Psychological and Social Approaches to Psychosis (ISPS) starting in March. Your brother might find trying out the different therapeutic approaches interesting and helpful.  https://isps-us.org/spring-series-2024/voice-hearing.html  Also if cost is an issue, there's some cheap options for therapy. Universities/colleges usually offer low cost therapy to the public for their psychology PhD students to gain experience. I did that before and only paid $10, because I wasn't working and they provided their services on a sliding scale.   Also as family, you can help him cope too with his experiences by being trained in CBT. There's a free CBT class offered by a university to family members of people who experience psychosis and there's free CBT training videos posted by NAMI on YouTube, which are quite helpful.  https://schizophreniaresource.wordpress.com/resources/#Q4  Lastly, peer support might be very beneficial for him to explore and it's free! I personally really benefited from peer support groups. I learned from others' experiences and gained more insight into my own experiences by hearing others' stories. Also I learned coping strategies from attending peer support groups. Plus it helps feeling connected to others with similar experiences. I felt less alone.   Here's some peer support groups:  https://schizophreniaresource.wordpress.com/support-groups/  I hope it gets better for him! Usually if doing therapy and peer support, people can develop more coping strategies where they might be able to lower their medications. These additive supports help minimize medications.   If he's not getting what he wants out of treatment though, there's also this really great Medication Empowerment program done by Pat Deegan that might be helpful. She teaches best practices and developed worksheets that he can use with his psychiatrist as a talking tool to make sure his personal goals are being met with treatment.  Pat Deegan has a PhD in clinical psychology and has lived experience with schizophrenia. She was diagnosed in high school. She did this awesome interview you might love hearing. It's an hour long, but really worth listening to! Her early struggles are very relatable. She started doing better when developing coping strategies.  http://www.collegestudentsuccesspodcast.com/episode-62-interview-with-pat-deegan/ (Her interview)  https://www.commongroundprogram.com/medication-empowerment (Program)  https://youtu.be/w_jWDXGuSdU (Presentation about program)  Edit: I personally don't deal with much anxiety, so I don't have any more specific advice to give for what I do. Hopefully others here can offer more specific tips! There's a lot of diversity and different symptoms for what gets grouped as schizophrenia.

The act of documenting it will help.   2) find an activity you like that requires you to get outside. It doesn’t have to be active per say, but spending time outdoors and around people can help with mood. Again start small and work up to bigger tasks as you get more comfortable. Even if you just do one more thing than you did the week before, thats a win.  3) A creative outlet could be a good way for you to get out and express some of the hard emotions you’ve been experiencing lately. It doesn’t need to be perfect, as long as it feels right. Then its right.  4) as for feeling ashamed for what you did. Its gonna sound cruel and cliche but you need to accept it and let it go. You were desperate and lonely and you made a mistake. It feels horrible and disgusting and makes you feel sick to your stomach but it is what it is and all you can do now is move forward. And like you said, you still have your v-card and you can still make a serious connection with someone you care about to have the experiences you want. All that to say, give yourself a break.

"Your sister is right to be concerned about you. Eating disorders mess up your hunger/fullness cues and skew your beliefs around how much food you need, so it’s really hard to set your own meal plan.

In life contrary to popular belief theres more than reproduction, if you want someone to love? what will you do with her then? do you really only want to reproduce? what about seeing different parts of the world? what about going out to try unique and different foods? what about even skiing or something?  sex is not everything and sex won’t be everything with her, she might want a man who can improve himself and realize sex is not the end all be all and you’ll want a woman who can empathize and satisfy you. Improving yourself comes mentally, journal down some emotions, regrets, things you’re looking forward to, things you’d like to try.  I only assume you hold a sort of “men dont cry, men don’t feel” mentality but realistically speaking a man who doesn’t cry is just a coward who’s scared to face the consequences that emotions can bring  back on track, not jacking off doesn’t better you when you still look at porn nor does it make you better when you don’t look at porn.  The reason not jacking off helps is because you find purpose outside of your own head that only has one fantasy replaying and its not bad to have a fantasy by any means, but when you chase your dreams you have to enjoy the journey too. sex work and all is not your scene and your prefer the more ‘pure’ lifestyle, that’s okay, you tried something and you didnt like it, this is not a lifelong mistake. many people have high high body counts and still land in nice relationships.

"The main reason why I had an ed was because I believed I was ""fat"" from lack of exercise. I had an average body and actually a very slim torso which I was not aware of until later on actually. I despised my body and inactivity and tried to compensate that by restricting foods.  I decided to run as a sport the summer before high school and wow, I cannot tell you how thankful i am for that.   The real switch was about 3 or 4 weeks into my training when the coach really emphasized how we need to put the calories back in that we burned at practice and it kind of clicked and I went from 1200 calories to 2000 calories a day.   It was like my mindset went from ""I'm working out to lose weight"" to ""I'm working out to get better at running and also EAT AND ENJOY MORE FOOD""   I did eat a very healthy, clean diet (no refined flour, whole grains, healthy fats, no greasy foods, only chicken meat, no sugar) though I had a little cheat day every Saturday for foods I craved.   As a result i gained a lot of muscle weight but got visibly thinner and fit!  Once school started, I had no time to cook and ate whatever and also let go of calorie calculating (before i made sure to only eat 1900-2100 cals a day) and i started gaining some weight back though very miniscule and then once I got on my off-season and really let myself eat whatever without exercise, I gained more fat.   I almost relapsed on my ED and negative body comments from my mom and sisters didn't help me. To be honest, I was struggling and started hating my body again.

"I wish I could hug you. That sounds so painful to hear from someone who supports and likely loves you to pieces.   I also had family members that never believed in me. I had family members who told me they gave up on me. I gotta tell you, it gets better when you improve situations and the nonbelievers become your biggest supporters (or saltiest haters).   I’d suggest you figure out what you want to do first: mental health or job? There’s no right answer. Some would argue mental health first, I would be one of those. But we are not you! If mental health is scary right now and you’d rather try tackling work first then that’s okay.   Second is making a plan. Try journaling and spilling out all your feelings onto paper, without thought, as fast as you can. Then walk away a few hours and come back to what you wrote. Maybe you’ll notice that patterns kept coming up, desires or fears, and start planning from there.

"Yes, I was even in an outpatient recovery program for ~1.5 years learning all the material in the groups and going to my appointments but refusing to change behaviourally. I worried I was putting it off too but in actuality I needed to learn about recovery to accept the process and feel safe trusting the process. After that stubborn 1.5 years, I had a feel for what recovery would be like and it’s only at that point I started to really mechanically eat with the intention of gaining weight and leaving my eating disorder.   But anyway, before I intentionally started eating, I would talk about my disorder to death as well. I think it’s because I was very slowly moving from the precontemplative phase (where the person doesn’t realize or acknowledge they have a problem, even if they’re suffering) to the contemplative phase (person admits it, names it, gets comfortable with it as a diagnosis) and getting curious about the change phase where you actually start planning real change, actually mechanically eating and doing so consistently with support.  My contemplative phase was definitely longer than most peoples’ (maybe it shouldn’t have been, I don’t know. I felt I needed a lay of the land and it mustn’t have been an excuse because I did change when I was ready, I didn’t push it off forever) but it gave me time to practice my coping skills for when my weight gain would start and my old coping strategies would be forbidden.   And I recovered. I only relapsed significantly once in an extenuating circumstance (COVID related factors) but have otherwise stayed weight restored and comfortable with it. I needed a ton of therapy alongside it though, definitely wouldn’t have been possible without it. I thought I was a fraud going into treatment too but it turned out I was one of the most stubborn people in any of my groups, and people like us are in more danger from this disorder. So don’t discount yourself. I did and almost died for it.   It sounds to me like you’re stuck in the contemplation phase, turning it all over in your mind over and over, sometimes concluding you can’t do this anymore, other times concluding you have so much more time before you need help, justifying yourself to everyone one moment and then the next moment wanting desperately for people to see exactly how hard it is living this way and being almost too honest. I think that’s all contemplation. Maybe you’re playing with the idea of recovery, but you’re maybe not sure you’re ready to leave the comfort of the pre-contemplative, everything-is-fine place.   In therapy to combat this, they made us do this mandatory first group called Motivation Enhancement Therapy for eating disorders. They had us do stuff like write letters to our imagined recovered selves in 5 years vs our imagined still symptomatic selves in 5 years.   I can’t find any of the exercises online, disturbingly I’ve noticed that more and more resources I used to link people to on here have become pay walled and stuff, which is so fucking depressing and dystopian, but I have saved all of my notes from all my groups, especially the motivation enhancement therapy group. I could go find them and send you pictures of them if you’d like.   Or else, try Googling ‘MET groups for eating disorders’, you can still find some scholarly articles talking about MET groups for eating disorders but most aren’t open access anymore.   I have absolutely been where you are, I think. Keep pushing and keep talking about it even if it’s annoying to people. Learning about recovery even if you’re not ready to change your symptoms right away is better than nothing. Think of it as low pressure prep work.   Plus, even if you try recovering before you’re ready and gain weight and regret it, remember that you can always return to symptoms to manage your body size again. Idk about you but I was very effective at suppressing my weight during my ED, and in a weird way that helped me because I was like oh yeah. I can just lose it all again.

"I was once told by a doctor or psychologist, that once you have it, you can never get rid of it. All you can do, is find ways to manage it and keep it down as best as you can, but it's never just gonna go away.  I know that might be a little disheartening to hear, but don't worry. With good tools and the appropriate amount of help and knowing yourself and your limits, you can actually live a pretty good life, despite your condition - at least, that's what I choose to believe, as someone who has dealt with this for over 10 years by now.  Try to think of it this way: your anxiety is not your enemy. It's there to protect you.

"There are 2 main things that helped me: first was stopping the purge and sitting with the discomfort of the binge. Binging became a lot less appealing when I had committed to not purging.

That in itself was painful but it ultimately gave me respect for food I previously binged on like it was nothing. That changed my food landscape entirely.   Today I have a beautiful relationship with food and my body for over a decade now. Learning how a living breathing sentient being becomes a “binge meal” was the best thing I’ve ever done.

"You will go into the ER (you can ask a friend or family member to come with you) and you tell the person at the check in that you feel you can’t stay safe or keep your loved ones safe. Then a nurse will triage you and she will ask you some questions to get more information from you about what is going on. You should tell her what you wrote here. She will probably take your temperature and your blood pressure and ask you what meds you are taking and if you have any allergies. If you can’t answer everything that is ok, they ask everyone these things.  Then when a bed is open in the ER for you they will bring you back, your support person can come with you if you want. If you go in by yourself they will take your stuff for safe keeping and have you put on a gown, a nurse will talk to you again and then a regular doctor will see you to make sure you are medically ok and don’t need emergency care for a physical injury or illness. Once they make sure that stuff is ok then someone from the psych team will come talk to you and they will decide (with the psychiatrist) if they should admit you to the inpatient unit.   Based on your symptoms they will admit you to get you treatment right away. I would be shocked if they didn’t.   I’m sure the voices are trying to convince you of a lot of things right now but I want you to think about your whole life and whether your loved ones have ever physically harmed you or attacked you.

"I think like this on occasion and one thing has helped.   Think back to a time when you immediately met someone and disliked them. As soon as you saw their face you knew you had to be rid of them ASAP!   Now the joke is you likely have never experienced this. It’s rare to meet someone and instantaneously dislike them. Why? Because most of us are thinking about being perceived all day - not perceiving.   When most people interact, they’re thinking mainly of themselves - how they should come off, what to say, what expressions to make, and if they’re not THAT self aware then they’re thinking about what just happened before they met you, the things on the todo list, and other external factors that could be influencing their emotions.   All of this being said, we reduce people down to fit our own narratives - not realizing that most people just don’t give af about us.   Now, that doesn’t mean that people in the world won’t act biased toward you. I myself have seen this happen in real life but you need to remember it’s NOT personal. There are SO many reasons someone might be friendly to one person and not the other - a list of very simple ones below:  -your husband spoke first and they decided to use all their friendly energy on him. doubling down on you would make them look fake and would over do it  - they’re more comfortable speaking to a man. Maybe they’re afraid that being too friendly to you could come across as flirting   - something about your husband is appealing to them. you be the own judge of this. maybe he’s paying and will control the way things go down   ETC - you get the point   Please. If I could offer one piece of advice, don’t take it too personally like I once did. A lot of people are just trying to get through the day.

I know what it feels like to have everyone walk out of your life because they can’t handle all the negativity and sadness you have. We all have a choice to tell that dialogue we have with ourselves to shut the hell up. That voice is wrong. There is still meaning and purpose. Once you’re strong enough to shut that voice up because you know it’s only saying things to hurt you, you’ll then learn to figure out what triggers it in the first place.

"Right ima put a HUGE TW for SH and SA, abortion and medical descriptions around both of these.  DO NOT READ. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE UPSET BY THIS. THIS IS HEAVY.   Non triggering stuff after the diamonds            For context: *im 15, have ptsd from SA and live in the UK. Im ftm (trans) do not ask me invasive questions, thank you commenters ❤️)  I was fucked over by the medical system. After i was assaulted repeatedly for months on end i found out i was pregnant. Couldnt get an abortion through the nhs, forced a miscarriage instead. Eventually i had complications including periods which were lasting upwards of 3 weeks and STDs which wouldnt go away so i had to give in and go to the doctors.   My doctors were the worst people i have ever met. And thats saying something considering my circumstances.   Went to the free clinic near me, got told to book an appointment and they booked me an appointment at the hospital because it was dangerous to be having periods that severe and sfuff ect.   Got to the hospital like a month later, and my doctor was a male gynecologyst. When i politley asked for a female doctor, they said no because there were none available. So eventually they just bought in 2 random nurses who were completely unqualified, but i had no clue until everything started up.   Laughed when i told them i think i have STDs. Also got given multiple leaflets on safe sex and not sleeping around and consent at young age, and even though i lied saying it was consensual with a partner (which isnt even possible because i was underage), they should have known something was up.   Immediatley started panicing, i threw up and then they were being rude about that, too. Demanded new nurses because i did not travel 3 hours on busses to go to the hospital for this not to get treated, because for all i know i could have HIV or something. (Thank god i didnt)  Eventually gave in and let the male gynecologyst in, he was lovely, but the whole time i was so on edge that i kept fainting. I had another nurse in there who held my hand the whole time and she kept trying to comfort me, but i was so upset nothing really helped. He was amazing considering the circumstances and really comforting and stuff, but nothing ever got done about my periods being so heavy, and they still are to this day.  Tests came back, i was right, i had a strain of hpv and chlamydia and had treatments. Fine, got it sorted.   I didnt realise how scared i was of hospitals until i had to go back again after a very severe relapse in sh.  Nurses refused to give me pain relief because i was intoxicated and ""high risk of drug seeking"" (whatever that means) (I had been drinking, but not alot whatsoever) and i required stitches. They decided just to go in no medication nothing, numbing cream which didnt work, and boy i was in pain, passed out, they had carried on while i was unconsious.  The whole time i was having some kinda episode and believed my abuser was hurting me, so i was resisting and sobbing and shit, and i was provided with no comfort or support.    The last few times ive been in for relapses ive had a doctor tell me i was attention seeking, someone else said it looks like i had a bad run in with edward scissorhands (wtf?) And got told my chronic pain and fainting is my own fault due to sh. I am so scared of going to hospitals that ive refused to go after breaking bones and throwing up blood since then.     This whole time, i demanded my parents didnt know, and there were no questions asked. I wish. I literally fucking wish the doctors called my parents. I wasnt in the right headspace to make that desicion?? Im not even sure its legal, but its done now and they know now, not that my mum rlly cares.    I have had major major issues trying to get diagnosises for my chronic pain and fainting. Every time i go to a hospital i freak out so so bad that they either have to medicate me or send me home, and its too much. I cant even go to a therapists office now or the dentist because those environments trigger me so fucking bad. I do online therapy now.

"As someone who’s dabbled in substances, the physiology seems to drastically differ.   While it’s a negative cycle with substance use, it’s not rocket science to understand how we feel better once that substance is expelled from the body even 2 weeks with medical management and we feel better. It’s usually people who don’t have access to medical detox and harm reduction that think detoxing is awful. It’s actually not bad under proper medical care. Pink clouding is also a thing and can last for an abnormally long time.   However, an ed is the one thing that just doesn’t feel better when you increase food because of how the body gets used to depletion. It’s very uncomfortable to tolerate food physically, emotionally etc. The brain does not react optimally even if brain fog lifts. It affects so much. “Pink clouding” doesn’t exist here unless it’s coupled with restriction. Eating enough for recovery just does not ever feel good, this is compounded by GI issues etc.   The physiology behind these two addictions differ drastically if you ask me. It’s not as simple as escaping addictions or not in a tangible sense.  Edit: Recovery from substance use will provide relief, more energy and mobility. Recovery from ed has you sleeping half the day all day for months at a time. You feel sluggish, still constipated for an abnormally long time, fatigued, in emotional distress, physically full, water retention…..The list goes on. After detoxing from substances (with or without medical intervention), the body does feel better in a very short amount of time. With an ed, it can honestly take years to get back to normal.

When we experience something overwhelming, especially in our childhood that our minds cannot process it ends up being pushed into the back of your subconscious mind and manifest itself as anxiety, depression, ADHD, and many of the symptoms including autism. The best thing for you is to see a trauma therapist, but since you don't have the money the second best thing would be to join a local support group. They are free and you might even make some friends along the way. The more you talk about your feelings the more you're going to process the trauma until you eventually start to remember what happened to you. You should also start keeping a daily diary writing down everything you feel and why you feel it. You should write down everything significant you remember from the earliest years of your childhood.

"I couldn’t even talk to people online about what I truly feel about myself, until recently.  I joined a YouTube group channel, and their kindness and quirkiness inspired me. They helped me, as I froze myself for almost my entire life, until the New Year.  They helped me look into myself, they helped me heal, they helped me discover my true worth and strength. And I want to help this group channel more actively, instead of being just an observer.  In the meantime, I kept asking myself. I asked myself “What do you want in life?”, “How do you live?”, “What kind of life do you want?”, “Are you satisfied?”, “What can you do for yourself and for others?”, “How can you heal, grow, and improve?”, “What are you proud of?”, and many other questions to understand myself. I suddenly felt like I wanted to do everything, unchained from my tragic past.  The road ahead is still very long, but I finally started living thanks to them. I still have plenty of anxiety and baggage within me, but they have helped me a lot. I started out deeply hating myself, but I can finally let go of some of that hatred.  I felt like I was stuck at the beginning point in my life for the longest time, left behind by everyone else. Extreme amounts of chronic and complex trauma froze me. But I’m living life more actively lately, and I feel like I’m catching up at record speeds. Maybe I might even surpass my peers, and I could finally find success in life.  I still feel like I’m not enough, but it could just be my extremely harsh self-critic and perfectionism talking. I’m not sure if I am right that I am not doing good enough, or if I’m just too harsh to myself and I need to let go of my perfectionism.  All I know is that it’s time for me to live.

"Honestly the fact that you were able to get yourself to go to the dentist is a huge achievement. I always put off getting the checkups because of the anxiety of how many cavities they’ll find. I’ve started to tell whichever hygienist at the beginning of the appt that I have depression, so while I am aware of the importance of dental hygiene, my depression hinders my ability to do an adequate job and I’m doing my best. Usually they are understanding. One hygienist told me that maybe I’ll feel better if I brush my teeth (and went on about how when he “feels down,” simply brushing his teeth makes him feel better) and I straight up said oh! I can’t believe that neither my therapist or psychiatrist has given me this info to cure my depression! They should just tell all their patients with depression to brush their teeth and the depression will go away! And he was just like well it’s just nice to feel clean and helps make you feel better. Mind you, I wasn’t unclean when I went to the appt (I always shower the morning of appts and wear clean clothes and fix my hair, so I don’t ever really look the way that the depression feels at any appt). It was so ridiculous and I think he could tell he shouldn’t have said that. Hopefully he hasn’t said that to other patients since then. Anyway, you are incredibly brave for even going to the checkup in the first place. And going to the checkup and then getting the fillings is not disgusting— it’s definitely the healthy situation! I totally understand how embarrassing it feels and it’s so upsetting when it’s clear the people who are supposed to help you think you are just making excuses as if you actively choose not to brush your teeth. I don’t think any of us actively think about brushing our teeth that often, and then when we happen to think of it, it becomes more problematic because thinking of it reminds us that it’s just another thing we are supposed to be doing and then the depression gets more intense, making it harder to get yourself up just to brush your teeth, and it just keeps going. I’ve gotten to where I’m (somewhat) satisfied with just once a day, but that isn’t something I’ve been successfully consistent with so I don’t even know anymore. Thank you for posting.

In the anorexia period, they would feel judged my me, because I wound't eat as much as them or I would fast, obsessing over weightloss and exercise and they wouldn't love being around me like this, both because they could see how sick it was, but also because I would make them feel bad, completely involuntarly. I never judged them in my life, my sickness was only my and applied only to my body. Luckily, they are extremely strong and didn't fall hard for this. But we could solve a bit the situation only when I started my recovery journey, with therapy, anti-depressants, and family.   Honestly, I feel you both need help to address your personal issues. But unfortunately you can't help them feeling better, you should focus on yourself first.

"I completely understand your anger and frustration over your current situation. It sucks that you feel like you are being forced into seeing a doctor that you do not want to see. I am also sorry that your university’s support systems were unable to provide you the support that you needed.   As someone who is in a similar situation as you (4th year of college, planning on graduating in spring, and had severe depressive episode), I was also told by a professor that I needed to see the university’s counselor or support services if I wanted to figure out a solution to pass my courses this semester. I hesitantly went to the meeting and it went surprisingly well. They were able to talk to my professors for me which in turn gave them a lot more compassion and understanding for me. They also helped me get a continuation grade for one of my courses that I wasn’t going to complete in time. I will say, this may not be the experience for everyone.   I guess what I’m trying to say is you might as well go and see what happens. In the worst scenario, you waste 30 minutes. In the best, your prof gains more understanding and provides you with more accommodations.   Once again, im really sorry you have been put in this situation. It does suck a lot.

"TBH, and I know this is going to get a lot of hate, if he was my son I would tie him up and lock him in his room until his symptoms appear to get better.

"The other person gave good advice but I understand that will be hard to do. I am a binge eater as well, I had a previous binging disorder but it switched to something else, I still binge a lot though. I recommend getting a nutritionist at least and/or an eating disorder specialist who will be able to help you with your binging. Advice my eating disorder doctor has given me is to increase my protein intake, I don’t 100% remember why but it helps fill you up and kind of tell you you’re good and don’t have to eat more. I went a while eating protein bars (I am not a big fan of other proteins so that was an easy way for me to intake protein and satisfy my sweet tooth that triggers binges) and I hadn’t binged once when eating them. I ate them in thirds though because if I had finished the bar in one go I would binge, I would eat a little bit of the bar and go do something else. If I got binge urges again I ate a little more of the bar. I am out of protein bars now unfortunately so I’ve been binging but it worked while I had them. You don’t need protein bars by the way, any high protein foods will work. I only used protein bars as my example because of my picky eating and sweet tooth. Having small snacks every 3-4 hours was another thing that was recommended to me. I haven’t done that due to other issues I have with food but it makes sense and it’s worth a try! The snacks may seem counter productive but it’s okay. Eat them in close moderation, find something that will fill you up and not leave you with an empty feeling stomach too. Things like mini muffins (saying this as an example because they’re one of the things I binge on) will not fill you up, which could very possibly make you binge. Don’t restrict at all, to the best of your ability at least. That is never the way to solve binging and will only make things worse, learned that the hard way. Don’t force yourself to eat super healthy food either. You need to have a good balance. Which is why I recommend a nutritionist. Limiting yourself to just healthy foods immediately will trigger binges big time since you’re getting all that stuff you’d binge on taken away immediately. It’s okay to snack and have unhealthy food, the key is balancing it with lots of healthy and high volume foods. High volume foods will help you with mental and physical hunger, which is a big thing in binging. Make sure you are also eating 3 meals a day too, do not skip any if you can.   Try to not limit yourself to low calorie foods or high calorie foods, find a good in between, and like I already said eat high volume foods!!   There is also medication that can actually help with binging. I wouldn’t try that until you try other things for a while but if you notice nothings helping even with a nutritionist and/or ed doctor I’d look into it. It’s really interesting how it works.   Don’t give up because binging will not stop immediately and takes time. I believe in you!!  Edit: I forgot to mention, find things that will occupy you. Things that require attention and time. To help distract you from binging since you’ll know you can’t leave what you are doing. But make sure you are still eating when you feel like you need to.

Well definitely sounds like disregulated eating and disordered eating at the very least. Possibly looking at ARFID diagnosis (avoidant food intake disorder) which is when the sufferer engages in restrictive behaviors surrounding food HOWEVER unlike anorexia this restriction is usually unintentional and is due to other factors such as sensory issues surrounding foods and is very common in the neurodivergent community (autism/ADHD)   The natural  physical response to chronic periods of restriction or going without food for too long and not having regulated meal times due to whatever reason can be nausea. Whenever I go too long without food I get nauseas and have even thrown up due to going too long without food this is because too long without food equals stomach acid build up as stomach has nothing to digest for too long.   People with EDs are more at risk for stomach issues such as gastroparesis which is the result of periods of chronic restriction. Going too long without the next meal means the digestion slows down and food sits in stomach longer and certain stomach muscles aren’t used as much which can result in the stomach becoming paralyzed and stop doing it’s job essentially. With this nausea is also common from food sitting in stomach too long.   Highly recommend speaking with a doctor about these concerns and exploring mechanisms and barriers to eating. Intuitive eating dietician is the evidenced based treatment for all eating disorder diagnosis’s and can help you explore relationship with food and barriers to food and what that can do to the body as well and why you may experience certain symptoms.

"I'd argue that her telling you isn't alarming, it's a blessing.  She clearly genuinely trusts you, which can't be said for a lot of kids.  And her reaching out to you has given you important information you need to continue supporting her and nurturing that trust.    Here's my actual advice:  Find her a therapist that SPECIALIZES IN EATING DISORDERS.  Seriously that is so important I cannot stress that part enough.  Also be flexible to change therapists if your daughter says things aren't working.  Learn as much as you can about eating disorders from reliable sources.  Maybe have a couple group therapy sessions, not for therapy but for educational purposes.  Also, this subreddit may look like a chaotic mess, but it's a very good peek into how bad EDs can distort how we view things.  There's many posts talking about how they wish their parents did/didn't do/say xyz.  Work SO hard on changing how you talk to her.  Stop any mentions about her body (telling her she's pretty as is or is skinny or healthy will NOT help), don't comment on anyone else's body (positive or negative), don't discuss or argue about how much she's eating (or other people's eating habits), don't talk about food in general in terms of quantity or calories, and don't shame her for any strange habits you notice.  First instinct will be to try and stop bad habits as soon as possible when they appear, but that could easily lead to her hiding habits from you.  You have been given a gift.  You clearly care a lot about your daughter, so know that you have a lot of hard work ahead of you, and it will be mentally and emotionally taxing.  But she reached out and showed an immense amount of trust towards you... prove to her that the trust is well deserved.   .  I originally had these flipped, but the advice is more important than my anecdotes.  The below is my story.  It shows what a good support system looks like, and how much of a difference it can make:   I was 23(?) when mine started, it was kinda like a switch flipped.  It sounds strange, but I could feel like a whole mental and bodily awareness shift.  As soon as I figured out what was happening to me, I reached out to the people I trusted most and told them.  That group did not include my family, and my parents still don't know I went through this.  I told this group what was happening because I knew they would support me, that they wouldn't judge me, but that they would also step in and do something if things got bad.  I probably had one of the best experiences of an eating disorder in terms of support.  My friends did their best to understand, and accepted and acknowledged when they didn't understand.  They accommodated my strange eating habits, but lightly encouraged me to eat just one more bite if I could.  When I went bulimic, they didn't judge me for what is frankly a disgusting habit (we know it's gross, no need to tell us), but would hug me and say it was okay and that we would try to make tomorrow a better day.  They NEVER brought up the ED unless they saw something worrying.  They let ME initiate conversations about the disorder, which helped me feel safe and that I could share as much information as I wanted up to my comfort level.  At a certain point, I was working on separating my thoughts from the irrational eating disorder thoughts and my friends dubbed the eating disorder ""bitch brain"", so we could make fun of the thoughts as a separate entity from myself.  This was actually so helpful, but I had to be able to separate those thoughts first.  They never leapt on behaviors as being ""bitch brain"", most of the time they waited until I recognized a thought as being irrational before adding it to the ""bitch brain"" list.

"Aww you honestly sound so sweet. She's blessed to have you  Everyone is different tho, what helps one doesnt do anything for the other. I can recommend some general stuff tho but what i would recommend the most is just to ask her. Ask her how she wants you to treat her, what she wants you to do in certain situations like being in active psychosis etc. But here are some tips  - do NOT encourage or feed into delusions. Like basically confirming them, that just makes everything worse and even dangerous for her.  - acknowledge her feelings. Tell her that you can understand she must be scared or stressed. Tell her you're always there to protect her and listen to her problems.  - if she's in deep psychosis or any other issue e.g suicidal, call or driver her to the hospital.  - make sure she takes her meds and maybe even remind her if she struggles with it  And the last thing, dont forget to also take care of yourself. People want the best for their loved one but neglect themselves to the point they burn out or start resenting the other person. The more you take care of yourself, the more you can help her   I wish you guys good luck and a blessed life together",schizophrenia,positive,aww honestly sound sweet shes blessed everyone different tho help one doesnt anything recommend general stuff tho would recommend ask ask want treat want certain situation like active psychosis etc tip encourage feed delusion like basically confirming make everything worse even dangerous acknowledge feeling tell understand must scared stressed tell youre always protect listen problem shes deep psychosis issue eg suicidal call driver hospital make sure take med maybe even remind struggle last thing dont forget also take care people want best loved one neglect point burn start resenting person take care help wish guy good luck blessed life together,SUBJECTIVE

"I'm starting to think this is just a normal part of being depressed or anxious and having bipolar. For several years I have struggled with showering. My husband has done almost everything he can to help me short of dragging me in there and washing me himself. I have some of the same reasons as others for hating showering. Like I hate taking my clothes off, I hate the water, I hate the shower curtain. I get tired, afterwards it's like impossible to get completely dry. And brushing my hair is exhausting. We have done a few things to try and help. Got the curved curtain rod so it doesn't touch me, I have a small heater and a fan if I get too hot, and I have 3 different shower playlists which helps distract me. I would do it maybe once a week but every time I would decide ok I'm showering tonight but then I would procrastinate. Each time I would go a few more hours avoiding it till I was awake for 25 to 40 hours and the longer I put it off the more anxious I would get. Then I would get upset with myself for wasting time. Also I'm on opiates for rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, as well as Xanax. So I would have to make sure I had a good level of pain meds and Xanax before I could shower. But every time I would go back and forth with nausea, headache, anxiety, pain, and they continued to cycle around. So with lack of sleep and procrastinating I would end up taking more meds than I'm supposed to, this is a whole other problem. Right now I am not totally sure how long it's been. Maybe 6 weeks, I have used baby wipes a couple times. I also don't know when I last brushed my teeth. I avoid looking at myself in the mirror. I've been having serious issues with my dad and I think it's worse because of that? I have to take a proper shower because if I get some kind of skin infection I could end up in the hospital since my RA med suppresses my immune system.

"(Sorry for my English, I'm using a translator)  Well, if you want, you can start with me. I've been following the subject of narcissism/children of narcissistic parents for a few years, and I guide and help close friends who have parents like that too xD  You seem to have very good self-awareness, and you also go to therapy, that's half a step.  About being able to trust new people, make new friends, why don't you try starting with your friends' friends? You can ask them to introduce their friends to you, thus expanding your circle of friends. As your friends understand your situation, they will certainly help you with this.  Another point, I don't think you should be afraid to open up to people for fear of being judged. Of course, this doesn't mean exposing your life completely to anyone in 5 minutes of conversation, but by telling your story little by little, I'm sure most people will understand.  Most people have no idea what it's like to be the child of narcissistic parents, but at the same time you will be scared by how many people have the same problem as you. Regardless of whether or not you have knowledge, if the person has a minimum of empathy, they will understand your suffering, and will not judge you negatively for it.  Perhaps this blockage is much more a shame that you feel than a real risk of being misunderstood or judged. In other words, it is much more something in your mind than a real risk.  And finally, you can make lemonade out of lemons. Talking about this subject, sharing this with people, I consider it very important, as it can help people who suffer from this without knowing it, to know what it is. It can also help people who don't suffer from it, but can identify in advance if they get into a situation where they have to deal with it.  In my country, there is a therapist who did this. She herself had an abusive childhood due to her mother, and when she discovered this, she aimed to study the subject in depth, and take her knowledge and experiences to help other people going through the same thing. Who knows, maybe you could do something similar in the future.

"You have already almost done exactly this, but if I were you I would make a list of the things you hate about yourself. And then try to come up with a solution for all of those traits. Some of them you can't change, some of them you maybe could.  For instance:  - Ugly face -> Not much to do about it, except losing weight if you are fat and grow a beard.   - Shitty hairline -> Hair transplant. wig or shave   - Skinny / fat body -> Lose weight / Go to the gym and lift weights 3x per week   - No talents -> Cultivate one. Start playing guitar. Start drawing. And make goals for yourself such as 'I want to be able to play song x by the end of this year'   You have no reason to exist because you did not find your mission yet. You are just living from day to day, feeling your misery.  What about this for a mission? Become the best version of yourself possible. Both in terms of personality as looks wise. Besides that, stop living a life solely for your own pleasure but devote it to helping others. Start a family (in the long run, self improvement comes first). Go volunteer and help old or disabled people. Start a YouTube channel devoted getting out of this depression together with other's. I don't know. Anything that you can think of.  Life isn't supposed to be fun everyday. We aren't supposed to go like 'I'm so happy!' everyday. It's your mission that should get you through the day.

"I’m going to be completely honest: help is worth it, but it’s often inaccessible.   The problem is insurance companies have very narrow margins for who they see as sick in terms of eating disorders. In my experience most of the doctors who wanted to help me when I was sick didn’t have the expertise. They would send me resources and ideas, and I’d reach out, and I’d find out stuff like 1) they weren’t on my insurance 2) I didn’t meet their practices criteria for needing treatment 3) they didn’t have openings.   I went to one eating disorder therapist who weighed me every week and told me I wasn’t really sick. By the time I stopped seeing her, I was doing much worse in a subconscious bid to prove I was worth helping — “sick enough”. It was one of the most miserable times of my life.   Most therapists I’ve met who do specialize in eating disorders will acknowledge they’re serious but if you’re anything but skeletal, they will often say things that subtly suggest they don’t think you’re really that sick. There’s an underlying belief that all severe eating disorders are basically one presentation of anorexia. Interestingly people I’ve known with anorexia that look like this stereotype also often have trouble getting access to help, usually due to cost and insurance limitations. Often they’ve had to also resort to finding what helped outside of professional help due to barriers to treatment.   I was always given tips during my bulimia like “plan out your meals” and “eat throughout the day”— which is good advice for someone who isn’t constantly terrified of eating and ends up engaging in behaviors due to underlying trauma and malnourishment.   So, what did I do?   For me the big thing was involving people close in my life who I could talk to without being judged in my recovery. Sitting down and, completely terrified, saying “this is happening, and I’m scared”. Being selective about it, at least at first. (Eating disorders thrive in secrecy.) I also looked up what had worked for other people in dealing with food addiction. ANAD, the National Association of Anorexia and Associated Disorders, has many online support groups that meet every week (you have to RSVP day of and there are limits on how many times a week you can join in, but sharing your struggles with other people who get it really helps).   I stopped romanticizing eating disorders. I listed out all the things that had happened to my body as a result of it and reminded myself constantly I deserved to not feel sick all the time. (Which I do now, but that’s related to an undiagnosed chronic illness I’m trying to figure out). ANYTHING that romanticized eating disorders, I got rid of it. No calories counting apps, no eliminating entire food groups (unless medically necessary), no passive bragging about being “too busy to eat”. I also smashed my scale. That was SUPER satisfying.   I also got evaluated for ADHD — for me, this was vital because bulimia was one of my methods to try and regulate a brain that was out of balance and I didn’t realize it. Eating disorders are very common and at higher risk for ADHD and autistic people, and as many aren’t diagnosed, this can end up being a way to try to regulate without the person even realizing it. That and getting on meds that helped my depression has helped soooo much.   Then therapy for the other things that were driving my eating disorder— in my case, trauma — was essential.   In other words, instead of focusing on changing my behaviors, the way we’re usually taught, I focused on the underlying things that got me there. These will be different for everyone, but it’s always helped a lot more than seeing a specialist. It’s not like I never relapse but seeing a specialist can be helpful or harmful and you don’t know until you get there.   I don’t want to discourage you from seeing someone! Please don’t take it that way. But I think it’s important to know that it may not go the way you expect, and to know that these providers can have barriers like cost, availability, and who they see as being worth helping— racism, homophobia, classism, sexism, and ableism all exist in mental health spaces too. Insurance also often considers people “cured” if their labs and weight are “normal”, even though decades of evidence have repeatedly shown us weight doesn’t correlate with severity and BMI isn’t a reliable indicator of health to begin with.   So… yeah. In my experience it’s just not usually simple. It is worth it, if you can find it. But if I were you I’d also work with your therapist on what back up plans can be if you can’t access a specialist, or if the specialist makes you worse. I really hope you can get someone helpful. Getting better is the scariest thing you’ll ever do, but it is 100% worth it.

Alcohol is an extreme drug in that it is fast acting and requires you to constantly have to drink more and more in order to continue to feel ok. People who have had clinical depression should never drink because drinking as a way of self medicating your depression involves being an alcoholic which is not a way to heal from depression. Not drinking may seem like the “pain” is 100x more because that’s how extreme alcohol is. It is 100x harder to recover from depression if you continue to drink. Step 1 in depression recovery is to just stop drinking alcohol. Yes it’s hard but you literally have no other choice but to quit the extreme drug. If you say it is too hard to quit alcohol then you need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous or if you have enough money or have someone with enough that cares in you not being an alcoholic go to rehab.

"The Psychology Today article says,  ""Since depersonalization/derealization disorder often occurs with (and can be triggered by) other mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, treatment can be difficult. For treatment to be successful, the therapist must develop an individual plan and ultimately address all symptoms and conditions.”  The Psychology Today article mentions grounding exercises, which brings up the interesting topic of mindfulness meditation. Some people say that they've had very good results with mindfulness for derealization but others say their results were disappointing.  I'll give you some examples of grounding exercises.  Eat a handful of raisins or nuts very slowly, appreciating every piece, taking a long time to finish them, being aware of your slow breathing.  Wash and dry the dishes very carefully, focusing on what you're doing, the feelings in your hands and the sound of the water.  Examine objects. Pick up a  few objects, name them, feel them and carefully inspect them.  Count things.  Breathing slowly through your nose, be aware of bodily sensations - the air passing through your nostrils, the feeling of your clothing on your skin, the pressure of the floor on the soles of your feet. Look around at the room, aware of the present moment, the here and now.  You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need and it can help with anxiety and depression, especially when combined with the standard treatments.",mentalhealth,negative,psychology today article say since depersonalizationderealization disorder often occurs triggered mental health problem anxiety depression treatment difficult treatment successful therapist must develop individual plan ultimately address symptom condition ” psychology today article mention grounding exercise brings interesting topic mindfulness meditation people say theyve good result mindfulness derealization others say result disappointing ill give example grounding exercise eat handful raisin nut slowly appreciating every piece taking long time finish aware slow breathing wash dry dish carefully focusing youre feeling hand sound water examine object pick object name feel carefully inspect count thing breathing slowly nose aware bodily sensation air passing nostril feeling clothing skin pressure floor sol foot look around room aware present moment cant go wrong stress management something need help anxiety depression especially combined standard treatment,SUBJECTIVE

"I have experienced serious cognitive impairement too. Hard to say what exactly is due to negative symptoms and what is due to medication. I almost lost my job a few times because of it, and can totally relate to the memory issues. I tried writing everything down but my ability to write was also impacted, and I would often misspell words or just write nonsense and not be able to keep up.   Eventually, I talked to a few trusted coworkers and my boss (did NOT tell them I am schizophrenic) but just asked if they would be comfortable with me recording some of our meetings, as I was “trying out a new approach to productivity to help with taking notes and developing action items.” I also record all my teams meetings which is pretty common for a lot of people.   Another thing I started doing when I cant/dont record meetings or just after having conversations is I will write myself an email summarizing everything that was discussed. I have a separate folder in my outlook account that is basically just a giant diary of all my interactions of the day that I can go back and reference. I still have some trouble like IN conversations remembering and being able to follow, but this has helped. I also will do a “recap” at the end of conversations like “ok, so just to make sure im tracking, XYZ is happening and I need to do ABC and you are going to do DEF”. It boosts my memory a little until Im able to write my email.   There’s also a few apps out there that can help. I used “Remember the milk” and “Evernote” before, but theres a bunch tailored to people with mental illness, alzheimers/dementia and traumatic brain injuries that focus on memory and productivity.   My doc put me on 300mg of wellbutrin to try and help some of the negative symptoms and lack of motivation. It definitely didnt do wonders for me, but I have noticed a slight improvement.

I tended to look up to people who suffer less rather than accepting the existence of this ocean, which flows to somewhere in a single direction.

"“She thought I wouldn’t allow ice cream so she thought it wasn’t safe to ask for that” is there a food rule surrounding ice cream in your house? I know many households like mine have rules surrounding food such as “no dessert before dinner, etc” and that one is pretty normal and common but food rules in general are part of what makes up the diagnosis and some rules are more extreme than others depending on household but I highly encourage avoiding food rules of any kind. Literally if she want dessert before dinner—let her. Part of recovery is debunking and challenging food rules and leaning into neutrality and intuitiveness. Any nutrition is always better than no nutrition. And ice cream provides fat, dairy, and sugar and if enough dairy source in it could count as a protein.   Definitely encourage eating opportunities and provide eating opportunities but don’t expect her to be able to challenge her fears 💯 percent of the time and know each meal is likely a battle for her mind right now. Eating can be very scary and uncomfortable. Something that is supposed to be intuitive becomes scary uncomfortable and foreign. Be patient. Try not to annoy be being too pushy either. Encourage but know when to respect her boundaries if the fear becomes too much. Some meals you win and some are harder than others.   Everyone is so different. I became avoidant during meals and found comfortableness in eating in isolation to the point where I would only eat in isolation and found company at meal times irritating and uncomfortable. I felt like people were always watching me eat and I hated the idea of being perceived while eating. In recovery though, learning how to challenge these fears and eat with community and be in the community and connect in general can all be aspects of recovery. Eating with her is good either way but some may find it uncomfortable and some may find it more supportive and comfortable to have someone to eat with at meal times. Truly depends on the individual.   Side note— it’s interesting that she requested ice cream. I wonder if ice cream is one of her safe foods like it was for me. It’s funny because diet-culture may label ice cream as a “bad” food and yet all throughout my ED it was my “safe” food. People have safe foods for different reasons. What made ice cream safe for me was it was a childhood food but also disordered reasons like low in calories and easy coming back up for purging. But people also have “safe” foods for other reasons such as texture or sensory issues especially those with ARFID (avoidant food intake disorder).   She is lucky to have such a supportive mama.

"Question semi unrelated to your main point:  how were you able to go to Indonesia at only 17 yrs old without any adults? Last I checked, international travel requires an adult to accompany you if you are under 18. Of course things could have changed I guess. And I guess you didn't actually say there weren't any adults, but it doesn't sound like it from your story. But then you said you graduated high school in '22, so that would be like April/May 2022, most people are 18 by the time they graduate. Even if you were younger for your class year, it would make sense to assume you'd be 18 at least by the end of the year in November. And it wasn't the November before you graduated that you went to Indonesia, because you said you went to celebrate graduating.. Did you skip a grade or something? But you said Maya was 17 too so I don't think so...   To your main point: I am so so sorry that you experienced this, no matter what your age is or was no one ever deserves to be sexually assaulted, EVER. Your assault is in no way YOUR fault, it is HIS fault. That's like saying it's a murder victim's fault because they were walking down the street when someone jumped out, robbed and stabbed them. Staying behind may have made Skip think you were interested in him, but being interested in someone does not mean you are giving them the green light for sex. You were clearly struggling to get away, you were crying, you said no. To most humans, this is a clear sign of non consent and all actions should stop. Skip DOES NOT and NEVER DID love you. Love is not forcing someone to please you sexually, or forcing the person you claim to love to do ANYTHING. Love is giving someone the freedom to do what they want to do, and then respecting and loving them for those choices. Love is CHOICE. You were not given the choice on that beach with Skip AT ALL.  I would recommend getting a therapist or talking to a professional, it doesn't seem like you have a great support network in your family or friends, so it's time to look elsewhere. You NEED to talk to someone about this or it will follow you and it will mess with you for the rest of your life. Find friends who are true and don't tell you they don't have time to deal with you. A real friend will never say that to a friend in need.

"When I was 17 years old and working my first job as a shelf stocker and courtesy clerk at our only grocery store, in the small town I lived in, I was basically told the same. My manager called me into his office and told me (in a respectful way) that I needed to begin saying ""hi"" and addressing every customer that came into my vicinity. In fact, the stores motto was ""talking to every customer.""  Keep in mind, I'm a lifelong introvert, I wasn't Mr. Popular in high school, I didn't have any real friends, and the previous year, I only spoke up in class if I was called on. In fact, I had only talked to maybe 10 people in total that previous year. Three of those people were my parents and younger sister. If you looked up introvert in the Encyclopedia, my picture was probably there.   Since I liked my job, even more so the paycheck, I slowly began conversing more with the customers and my fellow coworkers. Small greetings such as a simple ""hello"" or ""good morning"" turned into a few minute long conversations, which eventually led to much improved social skills and improved customer service.  My point is if this job is important enough to you, try not to take what your manager said personally, and make an honest attempt to converse more with your coworkers. One way I found to get people talking with me was to ask questions about them. Everybody likes talking about themselves. You can also bring up work topics such as discussing strategies on keeping clients motivated, throw in comments every now and then saying ""good idea, I think I'll begin doing that with my clients."" If anything, your manager will see or hear about you putting in an honest effort.   I would say that your work environment and manager doesn't seem toxic. It sounds to me like your manager is giving you an opportunity to improve your social skills that will carry over to other opportunities in the long term.

"You’re alive right now. I don’t care what anyone says, the fact that you are still alive is 100% more important than not brushing your teeth. Yes, you should take care of your teeth but take it one day at a time. Don’t beat yourself up.   Try and take care of the cavities for now and just use this as a way to find motivation. You can’t change the current cavities but you can prevent new ones. I’m not gonna sugarcoat it and act like teeth care isn’t important, though.   You can brush your teeth whenever you want! Doesn’t have to be in the morning or at night. If you get random motivation to brush your teeth at 1 PM then do it. Something is better than nothing. If you can only brush for 30 seconds, awesome!

"My doctor told me, ""Stop explaining it to people who won't understand."" It was the right move for me. It still hurts when people like my family just won't get it, but most of them will never experience anything like it. So even when I describe what I go through, I try not to be hurt by them not understanding it.   The hardest is trying to convey what it's like to lose my mind to someone who never has. And then there's (currently) unchangeable differences in how I think compared to others. (For instance, I wrestle with irritability because of the ""hot processing"" on bipolar disorder: neurological studies indicate that my normal is just more emotional. Bipolar brain/emotional hyperactivity can even be observed in euthymic/remission bipolar people doing ""cold"" tasks like puzzle-solving.)   Now that I feel better most of the time and have a life that works for me, I just try to not see my differences as a bad thing. I'm distancing from people who won't get it.

"First piece of advice: STOP. GAMBLING. If I play a ""luck"" game on a console, I never pay a huge amount of money. Only less than a eighth of what I have.  Second piece of advice: Try finding an outlet to express yourself. Take it from a 16 year old who's had depression since 2017. Sure, it never really went away, but I feel happier now than I did then because of art (drawing, sketching, painting, coloring, and especially origami). You don't have to do art, you can try punching a pillow, making a DIY dartboard out of tacs and cardboard, or even ripping paper, or playing a video game.  Third piece of advice: Ask for help. No one can do things alone, so pray to God everyday for help, forgiveness and advice. Trust me, He's helped me to pass exams, get rid of pains/aches, and even to help my dad stop drinking and now he goes to church any time he can! (HE DOESN'T EVEN DRINK NOW!!)

"I think at that point you probably need professional help. I was with an ex for 2 years and when we broke up, it took 8 months to get over them. I couldn't hold a job, lost contact with family and friends, was crying all the time, couldn't eat and couldn't sleep, basically non-functional. Then we got back together again. And later broke up after that ex became abusive and was cheating. I felt even worse because I had taken them back so I felt partially responsible for ""letting this happen to me again, and worse."" This time I sought out professional help and had weekly therapy on top of meds for anxiety/depression/ptsd and nightmares/sleep. It's been 3 months and I've been dating and doing well. I moved on about a month later really. I still have my job. I am still very afraid to see my ex but because of his abuse. In fact, I had court yesterday with him and had to sit right behind him and was a mess. But I'm not pining for my ex or letting them have another day of controlling my life anymore. The life I'm living now is the life I chose to live and it's good so far. I've also done the typical ""break up"" activities such as finding new hobbies, friend groups, traveling, exercise and self care things. Aside from time, different experiences and professional help is good.  It really varies person to person though, and what type of relationship you had. Let's say it was only a few months for you. OK. That might be easier to get over than a decade long marriage with kids. LOL. I also think my situation with an abusive ex for years is very different than someone who was with someone for years but broke up amicably. At the same time, you could be someone who is incredibly codependent and were with someone a few weeks and still cannot get over them, VS someone who was high school sweethearts with their partner yet managed to move on within months.

"Well it definitely sounds like your roommates mom has disordered eating and engaged is full blown Ed mindset and has eating disorder likely. Eating disorder behaviors are praised in diet-culture and a fat-phobic society. Disordered eating is becoming the new NORMAL it’s SCARY. Disordered eating will never be healthy it will always be disordered and caused very real medical complications.   The assumption that someone is healthy just because they lost weight is indicative of the fat-phobic world we live in that associates weight with moral value and health without considering other markers and factors of health such as genetics which we can’t control and body diversity exists and has always existed. Only in a diet-culture society do we greet one another with “omg you LOOK x,y,z!” Followed by “omg have you lost weight?!” Rather than a simple, “ HOW ARE YOU?” Why do we comment on how we look before we ask how we are? Diet-culture breeds a society that is weight and appearance focused and doesn’t truly consider health but rather appearance and moral standards associated with that.   I never comment on someone’s weight and especially NEVER comment on weight loss and praise it as I never know if I am praising the result of an eating disorder or cancer or other life threatening illness. Weight loss≠ success or a good thing all the time. In fact, a lot of times weight loss is indicative of a life threatening disease or the result of grief and mental health such as ptsd anxiety and depression can influence eating habits as well.   In eating disorder recovery I’ve attended many group therapy sessions at treatment where we have discussed ways to address and confront family member who are stuck in diet-culture and disordered themselves. Setting boundaries can be hard when these behaviors are encouraged and normalized and even disguised as “health” promoting when really restriction and depriving body will never be a health promoting behavior.   I think advocating for yourself and your needs was the best thing to do for self! Walking away and avoiding are nice but when you can’t avoid it’s best to confront them. I’ve had to set boundaries with MANY people on my journey. I’ve even had to tell strangers off who felt as though they had a right to approach me and comment on my food choices in a public space. These diet-culture Karen’s are getting outta hand!!! I’ll never forget when I was 15 in between dietician appointments went to Wawa to get a snack and challenged myself to a pizza 🍕 lunchable and this old 50 year old lady in line thinks she has the right to tell me a minor at the time that my food choices were “unhealthy” when it was already a fear food and I was challenging my fear of it in recovery trying to work with my team of actual professionals while this Karen is trying to tell me she lost weight and cut out all the junk food and referring to the food I’m about to eat as “junk”. Referring to food as junk is a huge diet culture cognitive distortion. Food is food, not trash. Unless you’re eating out of the trash can your food is not trash I promise you lol and all food hold value just some more nutrients than others but all food fits any intuitive eating dietician would say. I’ve had to set boundaries and tell loved ones that certain topics are off limits for me and it shouldn’t be hard to respect that boundary of not talking about weight—however people who are diet culture obsessed and disordered themselves may have a genuinely hard time respecting this boundary such as my mom due to them literally having the same mindset as someone with an eating disorder surrounding food and someone with an eating disorder only has enough brain space to think about food and the obsessions surrounding that and fears and anxieties and food rules. It’s all they think about which shows they have zero food freedom and an unhealthy relationship with food and self. In these cases I’ve learned avoidance and topic changing is best strategy for these individuals and I give them grace for being ill as well while reframing my own thoughts and leaving if I need to.",EatingDisorders,positive,well definitely sound like roommate mom disordered eating engaged full blown ed mindset eating disorder likely eating disorder behavior praised dietculture fatphobic society disordered eating becoming new normal it ’ s scary disordered eating never healthy always disordered caused real medical complication assumption someone healthy lost weight indicative fatphobic world live associate weight moral value health without considering marker factor health genetics can ’ t control body diversity exists always existed dietculture society greet one another “ omg look xyz ” followed “ omg lost weight ” rather simple “ you ” comment look ask dietculture breed society weight appearance focused doesn ’ t truly consider health rather appearance moral standard associated never comment someone ’ s weight especially never comment weight loss praise never know praising result eating disorder cancer life threatening illness weight loss≠ success good thing time fact lot time weight loss indicative life threatening disease result grief mental health ptsd anxiety depression influence eating habit well eating disorder recovery i ’ ve attended many group therapy session treatment discussed way address confront family member stuck dietculture disordered setting boundary hard behavior encouraged normalized even disguised “ health ” promoting really restriction depriving body never health promoting behavior think advocating need best thing self walking away avoiding nice can ’ t avoid it ’ s best confront i ’ ve set boundary many people journey i ’ ve even tell stranger felt though right approach comment food choice public space dietculture karen ’ s getting outta hand i ’ ll never forget 15 dietician appointment went wawa get snack challenged pizza lunchable old 50 year old lady line think right tell minor time food choice “ unhealthy ” already fear food challenging fear recovery trying work team actual professional karen trying tell lost weight cut junk food referring food i ’ m eat “ junk ” referring food junk huge diet culture cognitive distortion food food trash unless you ’ re eating trash food trash promise lol food hold value nutrient others food fit intuitive eating dietician would say i ’ ve set boundary tell loved one certain topic limit shouldn ’ t hard respect boundary talking weight—however people diet culture obsessed disordered may genuinely hard time respecting boundary mom due literally mindset someone eating disorder surrounding food someone eating disorder enough brain space think food obsession surrounding fear anxiety food rule it ’ s think show zero food freedom unhealthy relationship food self case i ’ ve learned avoidance topic changing best strategy individual give grace ill well reframing thought leaving need,SUBJECTIVE

"I’m going to share something my therapist had me think about awhile back when I began seeing my current partner, who is in recovery from alcohol.

He has a Tiger that he works hard to keep locked in a cage, because it will destroy you if you let it out.  And you don’t need it.  The alcohol is not something that you need, and it doesn’t fuel something that you want to be.  Nobody WANTS to be an alcoholic.   I have a Tiger that I have learned to keep on a leash.  Because I need to eat to survive, I have to be aware of where my Tiger is, and to manage its comings and goings, because multiple times a day I have to decide whether or not to eat.  And sometimes my Tiger rewards me with tricky positive reinforcement, because actually it feels really good to be thin.  Our society places thinness as a goal, as something that IS desired.  Until it reaches a certain point of unhealthy looking, my Tiger is revered and a source of pride in this way.  But it’s really hard to come back from that point when the switch is flipped in your brain where it’s hard to stop.

"Has he been having trouble sleeping, by chance? That can drive you bonkers pretty quickly.  I assume he already sees a psychiatrist for his ADHD, so if you have their contact info you could give them a call and see what they think. It would probably be better to let him know ahead of time and explain that it is *not* going to result in him getting put in the hospital (unless he presents a demonstrable danger to himself or others) and will probably just get him a prescription for something to take the edge off. I'd also suggest you accompany him to that appointment if possible, psychosis has this nasty thing called anosognosia (essentially, ""lack of insight"") that can make interpretation of events and prioritization a bit... unreliable. Not just for emotional support, but also fact-checking.  His work isn't going to know about it, literally the only people who know are his care team (who are bound by privacy laws) and whoever he chooses to share it with. All under wraps, can be taken care of quietly and discretely with nobody else having a clue.  Sometimes psychosis is just episodic, and early intervention is key to nip it in the bud before it spirals out of hand. When you let it simmer and pressure builds, *that's* when you have the real crazy stuff start happening like quitting your job suddenly, which I assume is the last thing y'all need.  Oh, and just in case he hasn't said anything to you yet that has crossed a line... sometimes when people are paranoid, they will say things that are insulting or demeaning (accusing you of putting poison in their food, trying to smother the baby, all sorts of bad stuff) so just try your best to remember he doesn't *really* think that, it's his mind playing tricks on him.  So, now that I've said *all that* which may worry you- you're in a good spot!

"Neurodiversity is a weird, clumsy movement. I've come to understand that ""neurodiversity"" outside in real life and in disability support contexts just means ""any neurological condition,"" which obviously includes schizophrenia. A lot of the core literature around the neurodiversity movement is inclusive of all neurological conditions, from foetal alcohol syndrome to major depressive disorder.  Unfortunately a lot of smelly nerds on the internet use ""neurodiversity"" to essentially mean ADHD, autism and -- because they feel they need to have a third thing -- usually dyslexia.  A lot of people with autism and ADHD don't like being lumped in with ""crazy people."" Shit, these same autistic people don't like being lumped in with autistic people who have higher needs than they do. I'm both autistic and schizophrenic, and I've had more than one conversation with other autistic people about how the latter is an illness but the former is an ✨🌈identity🌈✨which makes no goddamn sense to me because both impact my life, both can be understood as [neurodevelopmental disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2824976/), the only meaningful difference is the social narratives we tell and are told about each disorder respectively. Everything else is just mystical bullshit.

"I rejoice in the little things and really let the good days set heavily in my mind. And when I have a “bad” day, somehow it is still good because it’s a part of the process or whatever to experience a full range of human emotions and learn about myself and my limits / triggers. I spend time doing my hobbies but don’t put too much pressure on myself to create or be productive. I try and be grateful that I am able to do even little things, like grocery shop and doing my laundry and cleaning the cat litter and cooking for myself and others. I love spending time with family and grew a lot closer to my parents. I cherish my love with my boyfriend and friendships. There really is so much to be happy about and I feel that even though I’m not yet, and might never be, at the point of working full time, I can still enjoy life and work to the extent that I’m capable of while being a member of society. When I am lucky enough to have a deep nights sleep and wake up feeling well rested, I really make the most of that morning / day, since sleep is one of my big issues. I stay hopeful and come up with ideas on how to make money or get myself more involved in a project; for example I want to make a YouTube channel with nighttime meditation videos, and I just got a new mic thanks to my sister, so I can put my energy into that on days that I have the energy to work on a side project. Even though bipolar/ schizophrenia makes life harder, it doesn’t mean it has to make life bad. Also, listening to Joel Osteen and reading the Bible and praying has really helped me too. I try to see life as a marathon, not a sprint, so I am working on making a lifestyle that I can sustain long term for myself instead of pushing myself too hard and burning out and repeating that over and over. Doing things for myself like applying for disability, doing therapy, adjusting my meds with my doctor, finding a sleep doctor, getting an online course about how to fix my sleep patterns, reading articles and watching YT videos about my disability, etc all make me really happy and proud because it shows that I am putting in effort to make my life better and avoid future episodes. This post is very positive and optimistic, but trust me I get negative some days and some days are really rough, especially before my menstrual cycle.

"Also a few things about your thoughts that are telling:   1.  “The relapses usually consist of counting calories, but most of the limits aren’t restrictive at all!” — Calorie counting promotes an obsessive and restrictive mindset surrounding food period. You’re also associating food with numbers and more susceptible to the scarcity mindset which always fuels binging behaviors.  2. “I want to go back to counting calories” —this is an urge and urges serve a purpose. There’s always a method to the madness. Explore the WHY behind the urge with a therapist. Urges are also a natural and inevitable part of recovery. Recovery entails challenging and working through urges and dissecting urges. The urge makes sense in a diet culture world where disordered eating is normalized but disordered eating will always be disordered.   The binge restrict cycle is a cycle for a reason. These behaviors go hand in hand. Give yourself grace for binging or perceived binges. Even overeating in general to an extent is normal from time to time. the more you try to control your body the more your body will try to take back control and survive. The natural response to a famine or perceived famine or the perceived threat of restriction is indeed binging. In this way binging is seen as a survival response. This is why even having food rules and engaging in a restrictive MINDSET surrounding food and saying I’m only allowed “x,y,z today” and restrictions, avoidances, and silly food rules are enough to trigger the scarcity mindset surrounding food. This is why the treatment for ALL eating disorders is intuitive eating and it’s encouraged to listen to body, reconnect to body, rebuild body trust and have consistent meals engage in mindful eating and in order to do that you have to let go of the false narrative that we even CAN manipulate and control our bodies without them fighting back. You can’t possible be an intuitive eater AND control your intake or food. And controlling it always back fires anyways. Part of recovery is also challenging silly food rules that reinforce and trigger the scarcity mindset which triggers binging. Our THINKING alone always influences our behaviors. Even mental recstrictions are enough to fuel the urge to binge AKA natural response to restriction.   How to get out of a binge: change your thinking through CBT and DBT and have a team of therapist specializing in eating disorders and intuitive eating dietician. I view food as fuel and listen to my body and have sugar and consisted meals. My hunger cues are regulated due to having regulated consistent meals and starting to LISTEN to my body rather than restrict avoid and deprive my body. The body is so smart. The body is resilient. The body always has your back and is wired for survival. I thank my body for protecting me from the threat of restriction as it is wired to do.",EatingDisorders,positive,also thing thought telling 1 “ the relapse usually consist counting calorie limit aren ’ t restrictive all ” — calorie counting promotes obsessive restrictive mindset surrounding food period you ’ re also associating food number susceptible scarcity mindset always fuel binging behavior 2 “ i want go back counting calorie ” —this urge urge serve purpose there ’ s always method madness explore behind urge therapist urge also natural inevitable part recovery recovery entail challenging working urge dissecting urge urge make sense diet culture world disordered eating normalized disordered eating always disordered binge restrict cycle cycle reason behavior go hand hand give grace binging perceived binge even overeating general extent normal time time try control body body try take back control survive natural response famine perceived famine perceived threat restriction indeed binging way binging seen survival response even food rule engaging restrictive mindset surrounding food saying i ’ m allowed “ xyz today ” restriction avoidance silly food rule enough trigger scarcity mindset surrounding food treatment eating disorder intuitive eating it ’ s encouraged listen body reconnect body rebuild body trust consistent meal engage mindful eating order let go false narrative even manipulate control body without fighting back can ’ t possible intuitive eater control intake food controlling always back fire anyways part recovery also challenging silly food rule reinforce trigger scarcity mindset trigger binging thinking alone always influence behavior even mental recstrictions enough fuel urge binge aka natural response restriction get binge change thinking cbt dbt team therapist specializing eating disorder intuitive eating dietician view food fuel listen body sugar consisted meal hunger cue regulated due regulated consistent meal starting listen body rather restrict avoid deprive body body smart body resilient body always back wired survival thank body protecting threat restriction wired,SUBJECTIVE

"I am a very anxious person but nothingggg compares to the anxiety of high school. You just have to make it through this short period and start your new game plus when you hit 18. There are other introverted people out here who you can befriend and you will both sit and scroll together or read or paint or stream old shows. Adult friendships can be really fun and low maintenance.   Also, please hear this if you hear nothing else today: __people are not thinking about you nearly as much as you think they are.__ It sounds mean but it's actually quite liberating. Free yourself from your own microscope. Say something weird, do the wrong thing, doesn't matter people will forget. They might not even notice. This life is vast, it all just blends together eventually. Make the phone call, write a script if you have to, it will be okay and you will be proud afterwards. Just do it scared because it usually has to be done and it's okay to be afraid. It's not okay to let your fear rule and ultimately ruin your life. Everytime we let our fears stop us from doing something we want, we steal our own joy. We deserve that joy.   Being awkward or shy isn't the end, far from it, so please don't choose a permanent solution to a very temporary problem. Life gets so much more fun, it really does. Don't listen to people who say high school is supposed to be a blast, it isn't. It's a painful time where you do a ton of growing and learning. I was wanting to die at 15 as well but now I am 28 and very grateful to be here. I have a partner and a dog and a few good friends. I also didn't get my license until the end of senior year because driving is scary and no one had time to teach me. You are on your own timeline, no one else's.   As an anxious person, it can help to flip your fears. ""oh that person is looking at me I think they're judging me"" nah how about ""oh they're looking at my shirt, I wonder if they like the same band"" or perhaps ""this person frowned at me because I'm an inconvenience"" nah ""this person doesnt seem to be having the best day...""

"To better understand, what do you mean by you fear his behaviors may be your family’s fault?   As in you have enabled behaviors? What is the dynamic and relationship with food like in your family? Is diet-culture a huge part of your family in terms of beliefs systems and language and messages it sends surrounding food?   For example, due to diet-culture disordered mentality and behaviors surrounding food have been increasingly more and more NORMALIZED and disguised as “health” in society despite the fact that restriction food labeling and depriving oneself of food doesn’t promote health promoting behaviors nor relationship with food.   Does your family have a history of food labeling and attaching moral value to food and labeling them as “good” foods versus “bad” foods? Do you refer to food in extremes and diet-culture by labeling them as “junk” versus “clean”?   My mom had a very disordered and diet-culture relationship with food which is where the origins of disordered eating even comes from and that made it hard to get help as disordered behaviors were deemed normal in my family. I had to push for my own help and at 15 told a school counselor about the restriction and purging and over exercise compensatory behaviors and self harm. This is what ultimately prompted me to get treatment.   The evidence based treatment for EDs is intuitive eating dietician and therapist. It’s hard to get them help if they are still in denial stage. They have to get out of denial and see the problem and want to heal from that. It may be worthwhile to plant little seeds but I think an intervention may be necessary.   Family dynamics unfortunately do play a huge role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders which is also why family therapy is encouraged in the treatment setting. Truly family and learned behaviors and culture influence development of the disorder.   In meantime what you can do to at least not exasperate and fuel disorder and be supportive:  1. Encourage regular and consistent meals by providing meal support and meal opportunities. You guys are already doing a good job on this one! By preparing food for him and having it available regardless of if he chooses to eat and face that fear is a great supportive thing to do for anyone struggling. Provide meal opportunities—whether he takes the opportunity to challenge food fears are up to him.   2. Refrain from commenting on body weight or appearance. This one seems to be hard for supports as they are concerned and that’s valid but the reality is comments on appearance keep sufferer appearance and weight focused whether it’s a welll intended comment or not refrain from commenting on food and his body.   Comments on food and body keep them pre-occupied on weight and weight focused and fuel this disorder and behaviors. Keeep it NEUTRAL with the body and food. Comment on his CHARACTER for compliments. Send the message that he is MORE than a body.   Because pre-occupation with weight and food is the mask and distraction to cope with underlying root issues such as trauma. It’s a coping mechanism— it’s not actually about the weight or food which is why these comments are unhelpful as well.",EatingDisorders,positive,better understand mean fear behavior may family ’ s fault enabled behavior dynamic relationship food like family dietculture huge part family term belief system language message sends surrounding food example due dietculture disordered mentality behavior surrounding food increasingly normalized disguised “ health ” society despite fact restriction food labeling depriving oneself food doesn ’ t promote health promoting behavior relationship food family history food labeling attaching moral value food labeling “ good ” food versus “ bad ” food refer food extreme dietculture labeling “ junk ” versus “ clean ” mom disordered dietculture relationship food origin disordered eating even come made hard get help disordered behavior deemed normal family push help 15 told school counselor restriction purging exercise compensatory behavior self harm ultimately prompted get treatment evidence based treatment ed intuitive eating dietician therapist it ’ s hard get help still denial stage get denial see problem want heal may worthwhile plant little seed think intervention may necessary family dynamic unfortunately play huge role development maintenance eating disorder also family therapy encouraged treatment setting truly family learned behavior culture influence development disorder meantime least exasperate fuel disorder supportive 1 encourage regular consistent meal providing meal support meal opportunity guy already good job one preparing food available regardless chooses eat face fear great supportive thing anyone struggling provide meal opportunities—whether take opportunity challenge food fear 2 refrain commenting body weight appearance one seems hard support concerned that ’ s valid reality comment appearance keep sufferer appearance weight focused whether it ’ s welll intended comment refrain commenting food body comment food body keep preoccupied weight weight focused fuel disorder behavior keeep neutral body food comment character compliment send message body preoccupation weight food mask distraction cope underlying root issue trauma it ’ s coping mechanism— it ’ s actually weight food comment unhelpful well,SUBJECTIVE

"First of all you are not a failure. Being disabled is not a failure  It is not your fault that people leave you. Sometimes it’s not their fault either, it’s just the reality sometimes of being disabled.  I know everything sucks now. And ptsd takes years and years   I know it’s hard to trust. I try to build myself a network of people to trust just a little bit so that I won’t need one person so much  Over the years I’ve damaged a lot of partners.

But we still sleep in the same bed when I come over  However having things be this way let’s me have my partner while also having another person   I’m so sorry you’re going through this.

I takes a long time but there is a life worth living in the end even when everything feels completely lost   Even if all you do is eat and sleep and watch movies in your home, this is enough.

"Hi. I think you realize that you have neglected yourself and because you've stayed indoor for such a long time it will be more complicated for you to go out. But you need to start as soon as possible, small steps, just go out for a very short walks at first.  I'm telling this from the experience as I started from the walks through the town centre and it was very difficult for me, but now I'm in a much better place.  I've moved out from my country to UK when I was 19, it was hard, but I had one friend and he invited me. Your situation is more complicated, as like you said, you have no one to go with. Be careful about choosing whom to go with - there are different people around and might take advantage of you, especially when you are so vulnerable. There are very good people as well though. Like I said - I think you need to start from smaller steps. Just start going out. Slowly.  In regards to work - I have 3 years' experience as a Software Developer and I've applied from 100+ jobs and got only 1 interview. So don't be upset about that. Of course, this also depends on a country you live in.  Why have you stopped going outside? You have managed to go to music college, so you should have at least try going outside more.

"I’ll share my experiences with some meds and maybe it can offer some insight. Bring up your concerns to your psychiatrist and advocate for yourself and really thoroughly talk about your possible options and possible upsides and downsides.   I take Restoril right now for sleep. It’s a benzo used for insomnia. It’s not a long term solution but I need a sleep study at some point soon. I also have muscle spasms from a stroke known as clonus. Muscle relaxers like baclofen and methocarbamol don’t work for me. I had a surgery last year and they gave me Valium before anesthesia and right when I woke up from surgery my leg started spasming heavily again.  Xanax is given at low doses like that because of its addictive qualities. Building up a tolerance will just make you want/need more to feel the same effect. “Z drugs” like Ambien, Sonata, and Lunesta also have addictive qualities. Out of the Z drugs I’ve only taken Ambien and had to give it up because I was craving it during the day. It was extremely effective for my sleep though. I have had some milder success with Rozerem. 300mg of Seroquel for me was very effective first on its own and then in combination with Dayvigo, but a possible side effect of Seroquel is weight gain. It made me extremely hungry similar to cannabis. Remeron didn’t ever work for me. Now for physical anxiety symptoms I take a beta blocker called Propranolol.

"Short answer is no, it's not 'common' for men (male-identyfyibg or AMAB) folks in the same way as it is for women (AFAB or female-identifying folk).    The long answer: Not by as much as we thought, though, and we need to work on awareness I'm gonna use just 'men' and 'women' going forward as catch-all terms for the above, just FYI.    https://crasstalk.com/2013/01/full-list-of-tv-shows-with-fat-husbands-and-skinny-wives/  Boys are taught a different set of societal standards from a young age and the media they grow up with reinforces this. The above is a look at all the media that normalises the guy getting the skinny girl regardless of his appearance.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8910708/  The above is a study looking at body satisfaction and the results show women have greater dissatisfaction than men but interestingly both sees surveyes had inaccurate understandings of what the opposite sex thought of as ideal. So really, both men and women generally wish they were slimmer but they think the other sex want someone even slimmer.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2696560/  What this study shows is that while the gap between men and women is still there and certainly more women than men who meet the diagnostic criteria for EDs the gap is smaller than expectedand even then this study didn't examine over-exercising or laxative abuse as factors. It's also worth noting that significantly fewer men responded to this survey than women.

"First, I’m so sorry this is happening. I know what this is like, having your worst fears realized.  As far as it seemingly getting worse after only 2 sessions, I can’t speak for everyone, but for me this is completely normal and typical any time I have sought help with any issue, not just ED. The beginning of therapy is usually quite triggering, which can cause a flare up in certain behaviors. Most therapists will tell you this.   I can’t give you advice on what the best thing to do around food is, but please **do not** encourage exercising in replace of restricting. In crude terms, that is replacing one eating disorder for another (anorexia vs orthorexia).   It’s good to encourage food she likes. But beyond that, it might be the best thing to seek a family therapist. Encourage your wife to enter therapy too, especially if this is triggering her, and especially if she has never been in treatment before.   I also made it through the worst of my ED without treatment. But when I had a relapse years later and went into treatment as an adult, I was given so many tools to use that I was unaware of before. These tools have really helped me to stay in “recovery mode” even if I’m not in the “recovery mindset” if that makes sense. Sometimes recovery is mechanical, and going through treatment with guidance can help to establish a sort of “muscle memory” around eating.   Thank you for reaching out, you are taking the right initial steps. This kind of thing requires professional help, so getting her a CED-S was good (I’m assuming the therapist is a CED-S).   She also needs an eating disorder informed dietitian. This person should also have the CED-S credentials.   One important thing to note is that very few (and I mean *very few*) people in the medical field understand eating disorders.

"As a Army Veteran with PTSD although mine is related to Combat, I just want to point out if you aren't doing so, you may want to reach out to the VA.

Also there is a few Reddits for Army Veterans and VA benefits thats a great resource.. You aren't alone...Much of what you are dealing with is what a lot of other veterans are going through and while that doesn't make your problems easier, just know there are platforms for you to connect with others who understand..  As far as relationships go, you can't expect someone to love you and want to be in your life until you have learned to love yourself...If you're wife couldn't handle your PTSD and depression especially if she signed up for that, then it's time to cut sling load and realize you're better off without her...  I understand feeling alone..I hate being single but at the same time don't want to deal with a relationship..As silly as it sounds getting a dog helped so much...Having a dog to come how too, unconditionally love me made it seem less lonely...

"Your mom does not understand anxiety, if it is clinical you cannot physically fight it off. Life can really suck for teenagers who have to deal with clinical anxiety and/or depression on their own, and for a lot of us it does not get any better (not saying it can't).  If you are unable to get therapy/medication/social rehabilitation my next piece of advice is for you; I expect to be down voted for this, and I know it is horrible advice but it somewhat worked for me. If you are able, try to completely stop caring. Try to do what you can and simply move on in life. Things will still feel utterly horrible but you will be more functional, and quite frankly most people won't care that you have to struggle with that. There are times where you'll have to take the ""best"" option even when it isn't a great option to begin with.   My main point is to find what works ""best"". I'm sorry you have to deal with this curse, and I hope it's something you'll be able to grow out of it as you physically mature (there's a chance your brain will correct the imbalance as you exit puberty).

Is there a way you could you tell them and simply say you find phonecalls difficult, could you perhaps email instead - they'd understand.  In terms of advice, the singular most useful thing I've found is having other people to support me, to hype me up, to push me, to hold me to account. Makes it difficult since other people are the very thing we lack, but even if you're just honest with your family members or whoever, you ask for some help even by text - 'how could I make doing ... easier'. Even your online friend if you're feeling brave. So I feel like the therapist thing should be a top priority - they're another person who can help with motivation.  Additionally giving up things like youtube, and cutting back phone - reading books and practicing instruments, or doing art instead. These parasocial relationships comfort, and you'll notice how big an effect they have when they're gone - you start to feel lonely, but this can help serve as motivation.

"Sex is over rated anyways. Honestly, I am not a virgin, but very rarely do I have sex with anyone. It's messy, exhausting, and incredibly awkward afterwards. If a sex worker has denied you, she didn't do it because she dislikes you, she did it because she knows you deserve better than to lose something as important as your virginity to someone like her. To be honest, She probably saved you without you even knowing it. I have heard horror stories of sex workers being riddled with all sorts of STI's, HIV's, STD's and partaking in ruining people's lives because of that.  As for the people who blocked you, you cannot just tell people you want to kill yourself, especially over your own viriginity, and expect them to help you. That's wayyy too much pressure on their shoulders, for YOUR personal issue(s).  The people making fun of you don't know what's going on inside your head, and they're more than likely miserable assholes anyways. Many people prefer to wait to have sex for very valid and logical reasons. I wish I was still a virgin (at 25), because having sex with people I /thought/ I could trust, has brought me nothing but genuine pain. I did find my life to be so much better without having sex. I feel more in control over myself, and my life. I'm not constantly worried about it, as now it's just an after thought.The other people who won't be with you for you being a virgin, do have every right to wanting to be with someone more expierenced.

"I don't know if this is why, but I was the youngest in my family and throughout my early childhood, I was either excluded or just treated badly by my older brothers. For example, running away and inadvertently slamming my fingers in a door when I tried to play with them, tossing me down the stairs, trying to convince me that I had superpowers and that everything bad that happened was actually my fault, things like that. The funny thing is that they (my brothers and parents) like to joke about how I was a terrible toddler and cried a lot and looking back, I'm like of course I did. Like do you like me better now that I haven't cried in over a year because I'm emotionally stunted?  Then, there was my cousin who, honestly, just bullied me - physically and emotionally. He was always very aggressive and was fine with hitting me and my brother when we played with him and his brother. But the most damaging part was he always let me know he preferred my brother to me - and he was not the only one to tell me that; both his siblings told me that, our neighborhood friends told me that, our basketball teammates told me that, basically anyone who knew me and him preferred him, which did wonders for my self-esteem.   But what really kicked it off was probably when I was 11 and just started middle school and my best friend who had been my best friend since kindergarten ghosted me and I still don't know why. I can only guess it was because we were so different and eventually drifted apart, but I have no idea if it was actually that or if it was something I did.  I also had undiagnosed ADHD for my entire childhood and I think being judged for my symptoms (like high energy, talkativeness, impulsivity, etc) at home and being called annoying or obnoxious for it made me insecure and intently focused on masking in public.  And my parents didn't help me with anything really and put most of their focus on my brothers and I was the kid that everyone assumed was fine because I smiled a lot.

"I understand where you're coming from and what you mean. I dont think friends or other people tend to do it on purpose a lot of the time though. It took me a while to see that and longer to accept.   When I first started to process and understand my trauma it caused such a change in my personality that people noticed. I would attempt to explain or let them know what was going on without even going into detail and immediately people would get uncomfortable. Occasionally someone would try and relate by associating their own trauma or abuse  but you could tell that made them uncomfortable most of the time as well.  I think people just dont know how to process the information or how they're supposed to act afterwards. They dont know the protocol or if they should do anything extra or say anything and its easier for them to just slip out of the picture in the guise they're doing whats best to cause you no further harm or anguish.

"This sounds like my experience. I went to college in a big city and lived on campus for the first semester. I knew I didn’t have the best social skills but I thought eventually it would naturally happen, but it didn't and I pretty much stopped trying after the first few weeks. I decided to transfer to a college near home so that I could commute instead, knowing that I'll have an even harder time making friends if I couldn't do that while living in dorms. But living in dorms with roommates was more stressful and isolating than being in the comfort of my own room so I had to escape it   I also didn't know what was so wrong about me to make it so that I can't naturally develop connections. Truthfully I still don't fully know what it is, but recently I had a realization that I was just never able to be myself. The anxiety was always there, at best subtle. People never gravitated towards me which I suspect was because of the energy I gave off, and in the times where someone tried to interact with me, I gave very brief answers and couldn't keep a conversation going, or was just awkward.   It wasn't hard to see that I'm reserved, and even at the time I didnt think to portray myself in a more bubbly way because I was too anxious to even pretend. But even when I did pretend, it didn't get me anywhere because I think people could tell there was something off about me.

"I'm not sure exactly that the problem with your family is. All I can say is that whatever your problems are, your ability to solve them is greatly enhanced by having your brain in good working order.  Pessimism is a depression symptom. The illness makes things look worse.  My guess is that you have a money problem that's making it hard for you to get professional help. Also, the high demand for therapy has created long waiting lists.  What I usually tell people who have a problem with money -  1) Your GP may be helpful, perhaps in directing your search, helping you with your priorities, or giving you a prescription. You might get help at Mark Cuban's affordable drug company online. This  company is getting a lot of attention lately. Some are saying that it can radically change the drug industry.  2) There's a variety of things that can help - low-cost, low-risk things that are easy and can be combined with each other. I have advice from experts in my comments.

Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.  Do what you can to get a therapist. You may have to do a lot of research about this. Don't give up. Call your local social services (211?) and ask about Medicaid and Obamacare. Also, you can google ""affordable psychotherapy."" The cost of therapy can vary a lot.

In my opinion it's better to do it slowly, for example if you masturbate with porn every day try to remove porn every other day (i feel like porn is probably worse than masturbation i this case but I'm not a therapist or anything) and then try to masturbate only every other day or something like that, one thing at a time and don't feel awful if you make a mistake or if you can't keep up with your plan, just try again.

"I feel like many BUT NOT ALL SA survivors have either a decreased sex drive or increased sex drive as a response to the trauma. I have much experience with it. I’m inna relationship where that is the case but the idea of sex to them is “great” but when it actually happens they might sometimes or always wanna back down because all they can think about is that moment in their life where they got SAed. You just have to be patient with them, and talking about feeling and communicating is a key thing, but also she should seek therapy or just talk to someone about it because maybe she has pent up feelings about it that she should release. You can help by asking her how she wants things done or what might steer her away from the thought of it and etc etc. I hope things get better❤️",mentalhealth,positive,feel like many sa survivor either decreased sex drive increased sex drive response trauma much experience i ’ m inna relationship case idea sex “ great ” actually happens might sometimes always wan na back think moment life got saed patient talking feeling communicating key thing also seek therapy talk someone maybe pent feeling release help asking want thing done might steer away thought etc etc hope thing get better,SUBJECTIVE

"Hi- I'm so sorry you're going through this. I'm in the same boat with my partner and his ED leaves me feeling so completely helpless alot of days. Thank you for trying to support your gf.   I'm still learning and struggling (alot), but a few things I've found that seem to aid rather than hurt are:  Complimenting them OFTEN on things not tied to their physical appearance, i.e., highlighting how caring or compassionate they are, telling them your proud of something they accomplished, or how impressed you are that they figured something out you couldn't. Make it obvious that you are their biggest cheerleader and are there for them.   Steer clear of comments focused on their appearance for the most part, weight related or not.   Attend a family and friends support group- I just started this and it encouraged my partner to attend one for himself as well. Knowing their ED affects others too may be the push they need to start seeking help. https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/groups/ This one is on Thursday nights, for friends/family.   If you feel your partner wouldn't react poorly to this, consider opening a dialog about how she's feeling emotionally if you know she's just engaged in purging behavior. Sometimes muddling through the ""yuck"" feeling with them can remove some of that feeling of being alone and isolated in their sickness.   Hang in there- nothing about this disease is easy and she needs all the support she can get.",EatingDisorders,positive,hi im sorry youre going im boat partner ed leaf feeling completely helpless alot day thank trying support gf im still learning struggling alot thing ive found seem aid rather hurt complimenting often thing tied physical appearance ie highlighting caring compassionate telling proud something accomplished impressed figured something couldnt make obvious biggest cheerleader steer clear comment focused appearance part weight related attend family friend support group started encouraged partner attend one well knowing ed affect others may push need start seeking help one thursday night friendsfamily feel partner wouldnt react poorly consider opening dialog shes feeling emotionally know shes engaged purging behavior sometimes muddling yuck feeling remove feeling alone isolated sickness hang nothing disease easy need support get,SUBJECTIVE
