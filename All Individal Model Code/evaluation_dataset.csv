"Honestly this is a really difficult situation to be in, and I don't know what stuff he's dealing with or how it affects you personally. But the unfortunate truth is you can't help somebody who doesn't want to help themselves, and if his problems start to negatively effect you to a bad enough extent. The best thing to can do for yourself is leave.  I've been in the situation before, I've had a very traumatic life and suffered alot with mental health. I went through a very dark stage where I refused to get help or do anything and it destroyed my partner at the same time as she was the only one fighting. It took losing her, the only person i actually cared about to kick me on gear and eventually start moving forward again. We got back together afterwards though we split again a month ago for different reasons.  I understand you love them, you should try to support them and do whatever you can. But be prepared to leave and save yourself if you have to. Talk with him, tell him how you really feel, how his actions are affecting you. That you need to see him mske progress and try to better himself or that you can't continue to be with him as it's deteriorating your mental health. Understand that he may say stupid things, he might get depressed and say things he doesn't mean depending on his state. But actions are what matter and if he doesn't work on getting better, if he doesn't even try. Then there's nothing you can do. Only he can pull himself out, all you can do is offer the support and guidance. But he needs to be willing to do it first.  You can try to help guide him on the path, get him to do little things each day that mske him happier, get him out the house, do things he enjoys, hobbies etc. And try to help steer him onto the right path. But don't destroy yourself doing it. You can guide him, you can help him.

"As a senior in high school who also has social anxiety and talks with people at school but they’re not really friends I can relate.  I suggest taking small baby steps and putting yourself a bit out of your comfort zone in being more social. Like perhaps start by saying good morning to the teacher and bye when you leave, compliment someone or ask someone for help on something(even if you don’t need it). That’s what I’m starting to do to be able to slowly put myself out there. Make sure that you don’t push yourself too much though because it could be too much and just make you feel worse. But I think most importantly make sure that  while interacting with others you’re doing it for yourself and not so they could like you, if you get what I mean. If you’re doing it so that they could like you then you’re just going to make your anxiety worse because you’ll worry about what they think. Just take baby steps and slowly you’ll start improving.   I have a subreddit that I made for me and others, to set goals on their social life/skills. I just started this project so it only has a few posts but I’m trying to update it daily on how I try to push myself a bit.

"When I was here in recovery, I never got the truth, so I’m going to give it to you. If this gets deleted, then just know it’s because the truth is triggering. It’s triggering because recovery isn’t easy nor is it a walk in the park. My background is I’ll be in my 2nd year of recovery on the 18th of December (this month).  Yes. Overshoot happens. It’s because your body doesn’t trust that you won’t restrict or use other methods that depleted it of nutrients before. You will notice. It will happen. And it’s not just happening because of fear of not getting nutrients resulting in extra stored fats. It’s also because your gut is RUINED. And recovery is also traumatic, so trauma based gut issues are prevalent. Your ED brain is scared because it’s not used to you eating healthy and not restricting, so it freaks out.  I had to only eat one type of meal that hit all nutrients and it had to be Low FODMAP and vegan (I was vegan long before my ED, but some may find that gut issues stop if you momentarily remove dairy and even gluten).  I shot all the way up. But, it was worth it because my gut is healing. And, I don’t have to worry about ED behavior and I can JUST EAT! It’s a beautiful thing and food is so important in the human experience (especially when wanting to travel the world and explore different cuisines).  I would start by walking everyday on a treadmill at a brisk pace. Running could result in your cortisol levels rising because individuals with an ED have issues with their cortisol (the stress hormone) due to prolonged, stressful ED behaviors. It’s not all people, but especially for women, this happens. An ED ruins you hormone levels and you might out that you have a hormonal imbalance.  Hormonal imbalances occur due to the body not getting its nutrients for years on end. Some signs are abnormal periods, the return of your period is light/unusually heavy, you acquire cystic and painful/unpopable acne that won’t get better no matter what (you may need a dermatologist for the script needed to stop this), tender breasts, mood swings, and you may find that you have PMDD (PMS, but this disorder makes a woman want to off herself 1-2 weeks before her period and it’s SERIOUS… Many women with this condition don’t have the ability to understand that it’s just their PMDD that’s making them feel like this and they end up taking their lives), and of course, uncontrollable weight gain because you’re hormonal imbalance is not going to let you shed weight.  If you’re recovered and still can’t lose it, you need to see a doctor that specializes in weight loss and consider getting on an injection because if not, you could acquire diabetes. This is a last resort because you should only try injections if your body is refusing to lose even after months of exercise and clean eating.   Injections don’t take from the diabetic community. Don’t let chronically online people tell you that and compare you to celebrities who lead a different life than you. Medications are used for NANY different things, not just one condition. So, don’t let people give you issues about those weight management shots. My mom is on so many heart medications that I’ve been prescribed for my anxiety and acne. That’s because those medications also help the heart. The most common injection that you’ll be informed on helps weight loss because it affects blood sugar levels, thus resulting in weight loss that couldn’t otherwise been achieved without it. People who have went YEARS with struggling with an ED have blood sugar issues and a hormonal imbalance also makes it so your body can’t even work with the sugar in fruit, so it’s like, you might as well care more about your health than what chronically online, uneducated people think of you. An ED is a pretty rational reason to fix your metabolism issues caused from your ED.  You should also know that if you had an ED during your teen years to you early 20s, you’re not seeing your real body, as your malnutrition stopped your curves from coming in (and that plays a role into the hormonal imbalance). Don’t let the sudden curves scare you. It’s part of life and you might weigh more simply because you’re curvy and that’s fine.",EatingDisorders,positive,recovery never got truth i ’ m going give get deleted know it ’ s truth triggering it ’ s triggering recovery isn ’ t easy walk park background i ’ ll 2nd year recovery 18th december month yes overshoot happens it ’ s body doesn ’ t trust won ’ t restrict use method depleted nutrient notice happen it ’ s happening fear getting nutrient resulting extra stored fat it ’ s also gut ruined recovery also traumatic trauma based gut issue prevalent ed brain scared it ’ s used eating healthy restricting freak eat one type meal hit nutrient low fodmap vegan vegan long ed may find gut issue stop momentarily remove dairy even gluten shot way worth gut healing don ’ t worry ed behavior eat it ’ s beautiful thing food important human experience especially wanting travel world explore different cuisine would start walking everyday treadmill brisk pace running could result cortisol level rising individual ed issue cortisol stress hormone due prolonged stressful ed behavior it ’ s people especially woman happens ed ruin hormone level might hormonal imbalance hormonal imbalance occur due body getting nutrient year end sign abnormal period return period lightunusually heavy acquire cystic painfulunpopable acne won ’ t get better matter may need dermatologist script needed stop tender breast mood swing may find pmdd pm disorder make woman want 12 week period it ’ s serious… many woman condition don ’ t ability understand it ’ s pmdd that ’ s making feel like end taking life course uncontrollable weight gain you ’ re hormonal imbalance going let shed weight you ’ re recovered still can ’ t lose need see doctor specializes weight loss consider getting injection could acquire diabetes last resort try injection body refusing lose even month exercise clean eating injection don ’ t take diabetic community don ’ t let chronically online people tell compare celebrity lead different life medication used nany different thing one condition don ’ t let people give issue weight management shot mom many heart medication i ’ ve prescribed anxiety acne that ’ s medication also help heart common injection you ’ ll informed help weight loss affect blood sugar level thus resulting weight loss couldn ’ t otherwise achieved without people went year struggling ed blood sugar issue hormonal imbalance also make body can ’ t even work sugar fruit it ’ s like might well care health chronically online uneducated people think ed pretty rational reason fix metabolism issue caused ed also know ed teen year early 20 you ’ re seeing real body malnutrition stopped curve coming play role hormonal imbalance don ’ t let sudden curve scare it ’ s part life might weigh simply you ’ re curvy that ’ s fine,SUBJECTIVE

"Hello, seeking treatment is wonderful and I’m proud! The evidence based treatment for eating disorders is a team of psychiatrist for med management, intuitive eating dietician for re-establishing body trust and connection and reslationship with food and food barriers.   both mental and physical as they go hand in hand as part of eating process thoughts influence feelings which influence emotions pulse the mind-body-gut connection is fascinating. Truly can’t separate them they all go hand in hand which is why part of recovery is re-framing disordered cognitions to change how we think and feel about food. I would challenge you getting away from thinking about food in terms of numbers and calories as that is rooted in diet culture and the disorder and keeps us in obsessive mindset rather than intuitive and natural mindset with food.   In treatment I’m sure you will be working on that with a treatment team in a professional ED specialized setting hopefully as it’s a specialty requiring specific treatment in the field. What you can do in the meantime is try to just eat more regularly and consistency and challenge thinking of food in terms of numbers. Due to rests of calories counting it became my first automatic thought in regards to food and had numbers memorized and took years to unlearn this behavior and start viewing food as food rather than numbers again.  Try to eat by how you feel rather than ridged numbers. Try to eat three regulated and consistent meals throughout the day. Keep a good journal and log where you’re at on hunger fullness scale before and after each meal. Wrote how meal made you FEEL. What emotions came up during meal? What physical sensations came up? What urges came up? This is called a food journal and is used in treatment settings.  Example of a food journal catered to ED recovery After meal record- Before meal- where are you on hunger fullness scale 1-10 1 being nauseous starved 10 being full uncomfortably full.    Before meal: 7- not really hungry but could eat   Thoughts: pasta is a fear food of mine  Feelings: anxiety, fear,   Physical sensations: tense muscles   Urges to engage in disordered behavior 1-10: urges to purge is 8   Recovery record is an app you can utilize RIGHT NOW that provides food journals and thought records and is a good way to keep track of eating and emotion and physical sensations while eating and exploring relationship with food",EatingDisorders,positive,hello seeking treatment wonderful i ’ m proud evidence based treatment eating disorder team psychiatrist med management intuitive eating dietician reestablishing body trust connection reslationship food food barrier mental physical go hand hand part eating process thought influence feeling influence emotion pulse mindbodygut connection fascinating truly can ’ t separate go hand hand part recovery reframing disordered cognition change think feel food would challenge getting away thinking food term number calorie rooted diet culture disorder keep u obsessive mindset rather intuitive natural mindset food treatment i ’ m sure working treatment team professional ed specialized setting hopefully it ’ s specialty requiring specific treatment field meantime try eat regularly consistency challenge thinking food term number due rest calorie counting became first automatic thought regard food number memorized took year unlearn behavior start viewing food food rather number try eat feel rather ridged number try eat three regulated consistent meal throughout day keep good journal log you ’ re hunger fullness scale meal wrote meal made feel emotion came meal physical sensation came urge came called food journal used treatment setting example food journal catered ed recovery meal record meal hunger fullness scale 110 1 nauseous starved 10 full uncomfortably full meal 7 really hungry could eat thought pasta fear food mine feeling anxiety fear physical sensation tense muscle urge engage disordered behavior 110 urge purge 8 recovery record app utilize right provides food journal thought record good way keep track eating emotion physical sensation eating exploring relationship food,SUBJECTIVE

"Is this an ED?  Hi! Before anything else, thx for taking your time to read this post, I really apreciate it.  I just entered university this year and started living alsone on my own and I have been ajusting pretty well. I still see my family very recently and Ive been felling okay (as okay as a uni student can be).  My mom does not want me to get a job while on uni, she says i can get one during the summer but that the rest of the year should be dedicated to studying so I am living of of her and my dad's income. I am so super blessed by this and could not wish for a better family. Also, i have considered getting a job but I wouldnt want to lie to my mom like that.  Ever scince I entered college I have sloly started eating less and less, I dont starve myself and if im hungry i will always get something to eat but it just takes a lot of time to go make something and with my busy student life it just feels like an inconvenience.   While facing this i also found myslef less and less inclined to go shoping mostly because I didnt want to waste my mom's money. I went shoping once every two weeks and would spend 20 bucks max. I didnt let myslef waste more than that. I have talked about this to my therapist and she says that this is bad, thet i should eat more and that my mom probably spends more that that money whenever im over at her house.   I just cant spend my mom's money like that, she works way to fucking hard for me to just spend her money on foods i do not need. I feel guilty every time i use her card and waste her hard earned money.  I know my mom probably wouldnt want me to feel this way and she works hard so that i can in fact get this food but i just feel so guilty that she is spending so much of her money on my dorm and uni that i want to be as litle as a nuicance as possible.  I tried searching online for other people who might feel the same way but havent found much. I dont know if this post belongs here scince my issue isnt one with food but mostly one with money but i tought yall could somewhat understand me the best.  Thx for reading this post to the end.

The hard part was that when we can tell or see that these people who didn't respond to us have responded to other people (even much more happily or enthusiastically), and there can be different reasons to why that happens which is not always ""is it me?"", something that we personalize to our fault as a person, faults that we don't really know because they didn't tell us so we are left wondering in our own minds to explain.

"Don’t purge. It will ruin your life if you get sucked in. It’s one of my biggest regrets. Bulimia is just awful. Ruins your digestive system. You’ll barf in your mouth constantly. You’ll feel full after drinking a cup of water and eating anything at all. Your cheeks will swell. You’ll have vomit stained on your clothes. Seriously it’s quite hellish. And your weight will fluctuate A LOTTT. Like you could be losing weight initially and then your body will just hold onto the food for dear life and you’ll start gaining rapidly while still continuing to binge and purge. Do anything else. Stick to restriction. Quality of life is FAR BETTER regardless of people saying otherwise. You can actually eat if you want to even if in small quantities and you won’t throw up in your mouth after or deal with debilitating heartburn. You’ll also be tired all the time, sluggish, very disoriented and dissociated, dehydrated. The list goes on. It’s actually very bad for your health and causes immediate destruction whereas the same cannot be said for food restriction. I highly recommend you don’t start. People who say that both anorexia and bulimia are equally awful (those who’ve experienced both) are lying afffff 🤥 bulimia is sooooo much worse and everyone knows it. Do whatever you can to avoid it, reduce harm or stop altogether. Quality of life will skyrocket or just be better. Trust. There’s a reason why you’ll see those in ED circles who purge talk about wanting to stop purging, congratulating stopping the act of purging and trying to restrict. It’s because b/p is hell on earth. There’s even some people who let themselves do it only once a week or once a month to limit the vast harm associated with it aka weight gain, bloating, water retention, financial loss etc. Although restriction isn’t cheap either if you have to buy certain foods in bulk and new clothes to fit your shrinking size.",EatingDisorders,negative,don ’ t purge ruin life get sucked it ’ s one biggest regret bulimia awful ruin digestive system you ’ ll barf mouth constantly you ’ ll feel full drinking cup water eating anything cheek swell you ’ ll vomit stained clothes seriously it ’ s quite hellish weight fluctuate lottt like could losing weight initially body hold onto food dear life you ’ ll start gaining rapidly still continuing binge purge anything else stick restriction quality life far better regardless people saying otherwise actually eat want even small quantity won ’ t throw mouth deal debilitating heartburn you ’ ll also tired time sluggish disoriented dissociated dehydrated list go it ’ s actually bad health cause immediate destruction whereas can not said food restriction highly recommend don ’ t start people say anorexia bulimia equally awful who ’ ve experienced lying afffff bulimia sooooo much worse everyone know whatever avoid reduce harm stop altogether quality life skyrocket better trust there ’ s reason you ’ ll see ed circle purge talk wanting stop purging congratulating stopping act purging trying restrict it ’ s bp hell earth there ’ s even people let week month limit vast harm associated aka weight gain bloating water retention financial loss etc although restriction isn ’ t cheap either buy certain food bulk new clothes fit shrinking size,SUBJECTIVE

Can I remember the last glass of water? Drink some water. * Food? Did I make unhelpful for me food choices, like not eating or eating processed garbage? Eat something fresh. Throw out anything with HFCS or ingredients I can't pronounce. Find something crunchy to gnash with my teeth, visualize the bones of my adversaries being crushed between my teeth. Wash that down with fresh water.  * How long have I been sitting here scrolling?  Get up off my dead ass onto my dying feet, attach a dog if I have one and go outside the house. Breathe air. Get the heart pumping. * Check in on this one moment. What's my body saying? Am I tense, are my teeth clenched? Chill myself out. * Do I really need to get some venting out of my system? Write it down, on paper, and set it aside. Come back to it when you remember it and see how you feel after the fact. Do not trauma dump on friends, adversaries or abusers - at best you'll get a confused relatively hollow show of support. At worst you'll find out later that someone you thought was a trusty friend has put you on blast with your entire social group, police and your ex (for example).  Most of the time, venting is for us and won't even graze an abuser. It will make your friends feel like they have to do all this heavy emotional labor for you and that's inappropriate.

"Genuinely a really tough pickle to be in these days with social media absolutely ravaging the brains of young boys. All I can possibly think is that encouraging him to do some sort of hobby or interest that isn’t just a nauseating degree of self-flagellation might help him build a sense of self that replaces his need to be seen as whatever the heck he thinks he needs to be seen as. Remind him he is valuable without that. Ask him how he values other people and if he would demand that of them. Perhaps find some sort of positive media to slowly propagandize into a better outlook? Personally I find it hard not to scrutinize somebody like that directly. But given that you care about him and he’s a teenager, it’s likely that attacking the problem head-on could result in him digging in his heels and putting up walls.

"One of the greatest tricks depression plays is the feeling of permanence.  NOTHING is permanent, especially states of mind.  If it's your situation, that's not permanent either.    Remember, a literal fuckton of people have suffered from grave depression and come out the other side of it.  Yes it is a brutal and painful experience.  It sucks.  It sucks so much.  And one of the core tenants of depression is how it plays games with your mind, creating this illusion of seeing the ""truth"" that we're permanently broken and the world is broken and everyone else is broken but it's just not true.  Yes your feelings and your pain are real, but they are not NECESSARILY a reflection on reality.  Life is complicated.  It's not one thing or another.  Yes it is filled with pain and grief but that's because pain and grief are part of the deal.  If there's one...only ONE thing I've learned through all of this, it's that pain is absolutely inevitable, for all of us.  But suffering, that's not inevitable.  Meaning you are in pain and it has turned into suffering, but it can turn back around.  It doesn't mean you won't experience pain, but you CAN avoid suffering.  Which, to me, is what you mean by ""normal"".  Just a person who isn't suffering.  Has some peace.  And yes that is absolutely possible.  Yes it can be okay.  I never say it's GOING to be okay because I have no idea what you're going through or what the future holds.  But I do know that there is always a good chance things will be okay, depending on lots of different factors.

"Yes, this sounds like ARFID! Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder.   I hate the world right now because it’s reprehensible how undeveloped the psychology field is, almost stubbornly on the part of the professionals in it, full of bias and dogma, even in Canada and the US and Europe. Professional care can be extremely poor for issues like this that are multifaceted.   ARFID is hardly ever talked about and when it is it’s used to describe and treat children who can’t eat a variety of foods. I think also one of the criteria for it is that you MUST be malnourished in your blood work (to prove it’s severe enough I guess?) which is seriously embarrassing for the field. Needing to be in medical peril before you get a diagnosis or are taken seriously for an ED is all fucked up and backwards. I know even here in Canada it’s hard to be taken seriously with ARFID as an adult in the medical system, not sure what it’s like in India but I can’t imagine it’s very different.   What I do know about ARFID is that it can be caused by so many factors and it seems completely individual what the roots of the problem are. Autism can cause it for instance. But there are also situations where someone develops it due to trauma and abuse, for instance a friend of mine would always get yelled at during dinner with his family and that was a huge factor in not being able to eat regular meal foods and slowly progressed to not being able to eat  almost any foods at all (and he also had OCD, which adds another new element too that needed to be considered in treatment).   My point is that treatment especially as an adult requires a lot of involvement of professionals and tons of self advocacy. No one here can give good advice because we don’t know what this is stemming from (or if it truly is ARFID, idk I’m just guessing and it seems to really fit from your description).   Is there any way at all you can see if there are dieticians or anything like that for adults with eating disorders in your area? That’s your best bet to start, because no matter what you try for recovery, I think you’ll need a dietician to help you and oversee it. They can help you make plans for tiny tiny changes to see how you feel about slowly slowly introducing a new food as you’re ready.   In my country anyway, theyre usually pretty good about emotional support too, talking you through how your goals for the week went for instance (“did you try the muffin on Tuesday we planned for? No? That’s okay, you might not have been ready. What kinds of thoughts came up for you when you tried” etc). I hope you give this serious consideration because it’s such an underrated support.   And then I’d get in touch with an eating disorder therapist ASAP too. I don’t know what it’s like trying to get one over there or how expensive it is or if that’s even an option for you, but it just would be absolutely nonsense to try to do this without one. It’s like if you had a HUGE tree stump in the middle of your yard and deciding to dig it out yourself slowly with a small hand shovel. Sure you might be able to get it out of the ground and roll it down your driveway eventually, but it’ll take an unbelievably long time, years and years to do, and will likely involve you hurting yourself over and over through trial and error, and man that’s not worth it. Get the therapist, even if you have to find one that isn’t local and will agree to do zoom calls.   I just want to stress that again, I consider this severe and chronic at this point for you, and you need and deserve professional help. A dietician and a therapist (both who specialize in eating disorders) are a must. I don’t know how you feel about trauma and mental health and “family of origin” and all that kind of stuff, I know some people really don’t believe in it. But from the literature, from all the individual studies to the meta analyses of the individual studies, it’s just evidence based at this point and dealing with that stuff needs to happen at some point with a therapist if you’re going to really tackle this the right way.

Honestly I don’t have much advice other than to just dive into the deep end and do it. I’m a 26F now but years ago I just sucked it up and got a job caregiving while going to school. It was a job that I felt relatively okay with and my anxiety ended up getting better. I’ve since graduated and have been working full time for a year now and while it can be overwhelming at certain times majority of the time I’m completely fine. For me it was just something I had to get used to by just doing it honestly.

"In my life I’m basically alone all the time. I have friends but they’re all busy with their own relationships & lives. I’ve always been a very hard worker but I have nothing to show for it. Im in debt & there is no help. I don’t qualify for any kind of help, I have no family or friends to help. I can’t r afford to go anywhere or do anything I love. I bend over backwards for people & I’m taken advantage of or im told how “grateful” people are for me but it’s only ever words. No one truly cares. People only truly care about themselves & their own relationships & life. & that’s a fact. As an adult there is no one who really cares unless you die, then ppl care for a very short time & mostly move right on.   Unless you have money you literally have nothing & no one cares about an adult whose piss poor & has nothing to show for their hard work except debt.

Be happy you were “rejected” that was a blessing in disguise. You have a guardian angel on your back.

I had situations that even navy seals said they would be in a psych ward if they went through. I felt so alone and defeated that I went to drugs to cope instead of being told who could help me because no one will help me.

"I’m old now lol (44) but I remember being your age. I lost my period for a whole year when I was 14-15. I remember the shock when it came back. It’s extremely difficult I think being a teenager, like super hard and hopefully you can learn to give yourself some credit for the achievement you have made in trying to get a bit better. You have achieved loads in getting your period back. Well done 👏 👏.   There was really rubbish care for eating disorders when I was young. My doctor didn’t really know what to do and just put me on antidepressants which had a lot of side effects and I didn’t have any proper therapy for many years while I struggled through school, college and university. Eventually at university I completely fell apart and was too unwell to finish. I think if I had had the right support then the rest of my life would have been much better.   I basically started the eating disorder because I couldn’t cope with my life at all and I just wanted everything to go away. I couldn’t tell people how I really felt and I wanted to suppress my feelings. Unfortunately getting better means feeling your feelings and communicating with other people about the hardest things. This is obviously so much easier said than done. I’ve been in and out of remission with binge-purge subtype anorexia for most of my life since puberty.   These are the things that helped me most: 1. Accepting any help available even if it’s not ideal just give it at least a try because different things help different people. 2. Telling everyone you feel safe to tell and explaining to them very clearly how they can support you. This probably needs to include some family members, someone at your school and a couple of friends at least. 3. Learning to accept your body. This is definitely the hardest but eventually I learned to value my body rather than hate it. Doing sport helped me with this because when I got a little better and was more able to swim or run, I was able to appreciate my body for what it really is. At the end of the day we only get one body in this life and we have to value it. As you age lots of things will go wrong with it and you’ll learn the value of it, but hopefully you can do this while you’re still young. I’ve done lasting damage to my body from my eating disorder. 😔  4. Talking to other people with eating disorders. I go to a peer support group on zoom every weeks and I find the help absolutely invaluable. I really recommend a peer support group. It’s helped me more than anything else! 😊  5. You need to figure out why your have developed this problem. Until you know why and you tackle how it started it’s unlikely you’ll be able to properly recover. Just eating enough is not sufficient unfortunately. There is a lot of cognitive and emotional stuff to go through. It is really hard.   Anyway for now how about just take one day at a time and try to maintain your recovery long enough to enjoy your holiday and then see how you feel.

"Two things. Accept that it is part of you. And exposure yourself to it. You need to go to the social events. Participate in conversations. Talk about yourself. If your too shy to do that, then ask questions about the other person. Get interested in them. Focus on positive talking points. Get them talking and be a good listener.   Realize that your social fears are often unfounded or exaggerated. Most people don't think about you after the interaction is over. This is helpful, especially if you mess up. People are way more forgiving for your faults. They realize you are just human.   Remember, while it does get easier over time you will ALWAYS feel that fear. That's just human nature.

She was left bedridden for 2 years before she finally passed away.  During those 2 years being bedridden, we could only afford for a nurse to come during the day.  During the night, family would stay with her.   She wore a diaper, which had to be changed. You had to turn her so she wouldn't get bed sores. She was in and out of psychosis. You barely got any sleep.   I wasn't suffering as much as she was, but it was still extremely hard for me to work all day, and then go there to take care of her at night.  I loved her a lot and she suffered way more than I did at the time, but I still suffered also.  Now, after my schizophrenia diagnosis, my life, like most of yours is immeasurably hard.

"It depends.  If everyone's perception was gone and we didn't perceive ourselves then most likely not. Perception is part of being conscious. Therefore we would run on survival instinct.   If you mean everyone in the world was unable to perceive the looks of others, but could still acknowledge their own, then possibly.  Some of us don't care about other people's opinions on our bodies - I don't, mine matters far more. I see myself as wrong, even though I understand most people find me attractive as I am.   There are also people who want to be sickly, either because they like the attention and care people offer or it's a way to express how they feel mentally. So if it's only looks that can't be perceived, but sickness can be, then yes.   I think in a world where people can't perceive looks eating disorders wouldn't be so prominent, but they would still exist. Also there's an addiction to losing weight, and there are some people who don't do it for looks but do it for that rush.

"My advice is to go to an urgent care center.  They are generally less expensive than the hospital.  You can also make appointments.

Absolutely avoid driving.  If you are in a manic spin, your peripheral vision changes (at least mine does) and I have learned from previous experience, that being behind the wheel is never a good idea.

Interesting that your first reaction is to compare struggles. Pain is pain. Suffering is suffering. There is no suffering hierarchy as it impacts the sufferer the same.   Yes— both are coping mechanisms with addictive nature to cope with underlying issues. Both have servers medical complications in the body. Both are slowly killing yourself. Both are struggles. ALL struggles are valid. You cannot be addicted to a basic need such as food— however you can be addicted to engaging in a behavior surrounding food. It’s the mentality and behaviors that are addictive with EDs- not the food itself. As it’s a basic need.   Drug/alcohol addiction is mental and chemical. Chemicals literally change brain 🧠 structure and how neural pathways interact with one another  Eating disorders also change the brain and require re-wiring your thoughts and behaviors through therapy such as CBT and DBT.   Studies show  through brains scans that sufferers of anorexia nervosa and other restrictive EDs and the brain scans of those with drug addiction— when compared the SAME regions of the brain correlated to the mechanisms of addiction were lit up. It showed that engaging in ED behaviors such as restriction light up the same Reward system region of brain as it does in addicts.   So yes— not that different of struggles at all. Similar— not the same.

"When I was about 21, my professor for our communications class gave us a final project about bullying, where we would give presentations to local elementary school students, by blocks of grade levels (K-2, 3-4, 5-6). The professor gathered the people presenting to the 5th and 6th grade students, and said we were permitted to inform them about putting yourself in the ground, because a poorly treated 10-12 year old might genuinely begin to think about it. During our presentation, I got to talk to them about what some long term effects were (as both the oldest group member and the one with the most history of bullying).  Not going to lie, between my research, personal history, and fear of public speaking, I teared up in front of them during my portion. I had to tell these literal children to go to a trusted teacher or the guidance counselor before a parent, because many parents in my home area are not going to take mental health seriously. Actually had two teachers reduce my evaluation score for that, but my professor ignored the comment, because sometimes parents are bad.  Sorry for that long winded retelling, but if you think your parent or guardian would be okay with you talking to the doctor about medication, or trying therapy, it would certainly be worth a shot. I know money may be a limiting factor.  For what it’s worth I’m closing in on 30. I know every single person 10+ years older than you is going to tell you “life does get better” and it’s hard to believe. Hell, I’m still skeptical of it a little bit myself, but I’ve gotten a lot of things done that would make my 15 year old self think I was lying. For example: two years after nearly sobbing in front of 10-12 year olds, I moved to a new city. Got a job I love. A year after that, I met the person who is now my wife. We now have a house, two pets, and I am working to finish my college degree (ADHD is awful).   There is so much life to live, and so many people whose lives you have had a positive impact on. There’s going to be ups and downs, and as much as I hate those downs, the ups have been a lot higher and the downs nowhere near as low since I’ve gotten older. Ripping off the bandage has to happen sometimes, and often times, leads to positive outcomes. It’s ended toxic friendships, which hurt badly in the moment, but I feel much better now. Even my grandmother, who is in her 90s, says her life has been much better since the 1950s, when she crossed into her 20s.

I think my childhood played a role in it. I mean looking back at it I always had a hard time maintaining friendships when younger. I never had an actual “friend group” because everyone always left. It wasn’t until I met one friend who i thought i could be close with. We went to middle school together and that’s when things changed. She turned on me and left me alone I ended up having a harder time finding friends because everyone already had their own cliques and later was bullied badly for being a loner. High school was better because I did end up finding a friend group again but I think at that point I had an avoidant attachment cause I got scared with getting too close with these friends because I always felt like they’d throw me away like previous experiences. This followed me up until now in my early 20’s as I have a hard time making/maintaining relationships because i don’t know how to properly socialize.

Sure, therapy can help, but they can’t force food down your throat (believe me, they won’t even try). Do you want your old life back? Take action. Are you comfortable with starving yourself for the rest of your life? Good luck living a long and fulfilling life.  It’s important to separate the two voices in your head: you and your ED. Are you restricting yourself, or is your ED restricting you? Do you not want a slice of bread because you’re not hungry, or does your ED think you don’t deserve it? Before you’ll be able to change the thought pattern, you need to understand the thought pattern.  And be patient and kind to yourself. Everyone deserves food. Does a car not deserve gas? That sounds silly, doesn’t it? We all know a car NEEDS gas. We never question whether it deserves it or not. The same goes for your body: it NEEDS fuel.

"I am so sorry you are going through this. My heart breaks for you and your daughter. I'm 39. I've dealt with bulimia since I was 10 years old. However, I can recall as far back as 4 year old preschool and thinking the other girls were better than me because they had long hair or because they fit on their nap time mats better than I did. Seriously, who thinks like that at just 4 years old? I hid my eating disorder for years. My sister knew, only because she also had bulimia. I learned in treatment (age 29 or 30) that people are born that way. People with eating disorders are wired differently in their brains and at some point in their lives, something sets it off. There's absolutely NOTHING you did wrong as a parent. As someone who had an eating disorder for sooooo many years, I learned every trick in the book so I could keep it a secret from everyone. It wasn't that I was necessarily ashamed of my eating disorder, but more so that I was afraid of people finding out and then trying to force me into treatment. I did not want to seek treatment. My eating disorder was my coping mechanism for anything and everything. I wasn't ready to give it up just because someone thought I should. And the hardest thing to accept is that no matter how hard you push or try to help your daughter, until she is genuinely ready to help herself, there's nothing you can do. Other than letting her know that you love her and support her through thick and thin, you can't force her to recover if she doesn't have the will to do it herself. Over the past 9 months, my thyroid has been funky as hell and I've gained 15 pounds. I'm freaking out because nothing fits and I'm so uncomfortable. I'm riding a slippery slope between recovery and relapse. But the truth is, no one...not even myself, has done anything wrong. This could not have been prevented. I can't blame my mom, myself, or my husband. Just as you can't blame yourself. Take it one meal at a time. If one meal doesn't go well, that doesn't mean the whole day is ruined. There's more meals and days to come. It might get worse before it gets better, but it will get better with the right help and support.

"I thought the same but I put some more effort in work and friends then things got somewhat better. Just had to do everything I could to keep busy and my mind off of it. I didn’t seek professional help until much later which I regret because it would have helped better than when I finally got help at 40.  I guess Jesus can be helpful.. some of the friends I met through church are great but I prayed about it since I was 10. All these years later I’m still not sure how Jesus helps when you are in despair and see no point in life and that you believe everyone is better off without you. I have been just putting it off every time. I think, why now? If I feel this bad later on, I can just do it then. Been doing this for years and seen some really dark times but, in my case, I can wait it out and it will go away. I know there are people unlike me where I rebound and feel somewhat better (like a mild bi-polar disorder) even really good.. just not quite manic but then the darkness comes and it sucks.

">To make things worse you can tell easily when I'm uncomfortable because of my body language which I find hard to control  You've said something extremely interesting to many. We try to force ourselves to control our body language, posture, eye contact, and tonality, without realizing that everything is controlled subconsciously to confirm our belief systems that manifest themselves through our behavior. One of the biggest pieces of advice I can give you is to learn how to control your mind first, before trying to change your behavior. If you want to maintain eye contact but deep inside you believe it's awkward or inappropriate, or that the other person won't like it, even if you manage to do it, you will always feel it's unnatural and fake.

"Hello, I also had an ED a few years back(anorexia to be exact).

"My heart breaks for you and the family. Eating disorders are a beast. Trying to understand and navigate the world of an eating disorder is like trying to smell the color 9...it never makes sense! Fortunately (and unfortunately) you have a personal history with disordered eating so you actually understand eating disorders and have an insider knowledge/intuition that the vast majority of people will never have. I've dealt with bulimia and restricted eating for 29 years, been in recovery for the past 7, but I can easily pick up on others habits and behaviors because I've been there and done that. Reading your post, I had the same thoughts about the broth that you have...it's a means to restrict. Here's the toughest piece of advice that I can pass along to you and it will suck to hear this. Unless she is truly and genuinely wanting to recover and eliminate her disordered eating, she will continue to sabotage herself and find ways to restrict and keep herself in the eating disorder NO MATTER what you or anyone else does. You cannot force someone to stop or slowly taper their behaviors unless they 200% want to get better themselves and are committed to doing anything and everything possible to recover. If she is in fact at the point of wanting to do anything and everything to recover, I love the idea of taking her food and eating with her. Stay with her for at least an hour after eating to make sure she doesn't purge. Perhaps you, your partner, and her husband can take turns having a meal with her. Have you guys considered an inpatient therapy program to get her on track or even an extensive outpatient program? There are options for help, you don't have to go this alone.

"I suffer from bulimia and I can relate to this. I've been in recovery for the past 3 years and I can say that having thoughts like these and feeling like you're getting worse again is completely normal and you just have to keep trying and not give up. Sometimes you might get worse and not get better for days or even weeks but then when you do get better it'll bring you even closer to recovery. Recovery can take many years and relapsing is part of the process. On some days you'll feel like your Ed has complete control over you and some days you'll feel like you're above it. Sometimes I still throw up and whenever I do I feel like I've lost all process but then I think back to how much worse it used to be and think: ""hey, I've made it this far. Why should I not be able to go even further?"". Part of recovery is focusing on the future and letting go of the past. So instead of thinking about how much more in control you felt a few days ago try to think about how much more in control you WILL BE.

Thirdly, as a fellow Canadian you need to understand that anything provided by our government is very low quality, since it is free people that will go to hospitals for any minor inconvenience they might have which clogs up the wait for people who really need it. what I can recommend to you is if you feel even the slightest minor distress towards yourself is go to the hospital and tell them you have regular occurring suicidal thoughts because the first thing they will do is a 48 hour hold in the psych ward. and to get out of there a licensed therapist will have to deem you safe to release. it is the quickest and best way to jump that 8 month line and get the proper health you need, not only will they set you up with a therapist but also a psychiatrist who can prescribe the good pills and diagnose any mental health problems you may have. i can understand that may be difficult to explain to old fashioned family members but it may also be the huge slap in the face that your family needs that you need help your not getting and if you do get any sort of diagnosis from it then it gives you something to work off of. checking this feed in 12 hours if you have any questions for me  best of luck and please don't do anything to further harm yourself as it only sets reminders to your future self.

"It is not your responsibility to ""get over"" what happened because it upsets enablers. You spoke your truth.   The people who snap at you for ""rocking the boat"" are too fucked in the head to be telling anyone what's right and wrong.   I think when faced with the reality that someone they love is an abuser, people feel it's easier to attack, blame, or smear the victim, than it is to face what that abuser has done. They don't want to face reality so they attack it because they don't want to accept the part they play in enabling/protecting an abuser or the shame that comes with it. When they don't want that shame or responsibility? They project it onto you and say it's your fault you were harmed and that you are a shameful person.  Abuse is the abuser's fault. Nothing is stopping them from doing what's right, they choose to do what's wrong, and they choose people who will enable them or be attack dogs.   You are not responsible for getting molested, that's disgusting to say, and only a disgusting person would say it.   You are not a bad person for what happened.   If you abused someone and allowed everyone to attack your victim to protect you? You'd be a bad person.   If you told someone it's their fault they were molested? You'd be a bad person.

"A big part of who I am comes from that same feeling of nobody coming to help me. In fact when I asked for help I was told *I* was the problem for a very very long time. To this day it drives me to be kind long past when I should reasonably throttle someone. But we all wear that trauma differently.   The first thing to realize is that you cannot shut down that feeling. It's there, it will persist, and I hate to say that only time will help heal it. Your fight-or-flight is on high alert for a good reason, just not a convenient one. What you are experiencing isn't abnormal, it's probably one of the most rational things about what happens to us. So please forgive yourself for that part right now.  Your dreams are a harder thing to deal with. However I always recommend a movie to anyone who suffers from nightmares. It's an 80s movie called Dreamscape. Little dated now, but the concept is still sound: It's your dream, so you *can* control it. It takes practice and time, but being able to recognize in a nightmare ""This isn't real"" is a life preserver.  For now all I can say is that I'm sorry and that you can/will get through this. It hurts, it drags you down a little and it feels like an endless cycle sometimes. But you can rise above it. You just have to hold on long enough to heal, and allow yourself the ability to.  But until then if you need anything, day or night, we're all here. We've walked through hell too, and if you feel like you need a partner for the stroll let us know. I think I speak for everyone in this entire sub when I say we refuse to leave others behind. That includes you. So don't be afraid to raise your hand.  Good luck, and I hope peace finds you.

"The psych ward is not a place equipped with the right psychological care for a person suffering a schizophrenia because they dont understand the complexities of each case and usually just try to solve the problem with heavy tranquilisers which don't help the underlying issue for the admission as the spiral of the symptoms getting bad are usually understood by a therapist finding out why the schizophrenia has worsened during the period but focusing on points like environmental stresses, life events, work, diet, mood, and things which may cause certain symptoms to flare. A lot of the time things like delusional thinking, stressful social interactions or lack thereof, and general handling of symptoms which are done through coping techniques are things which may have changed suddenly causing a spiral. I dont believe you need a psych ward unless you are a danger to yourself or others but usually during symptoms getting bad it's not an issue since having the condition you learn how to go into an upward spiral. But a lot of the time an episode is not something you need to be admitted for as it's often a panic attack that eventually you recover from. Often people mistake schizophrenia episodes as being violent but that is only in rare cases. Most people just panic and don't know what to do so just do nothing or gete extremely upset.

"*Lengthy reply, but thank you for your vulnerability, your post has been helpful to me. I’ve been feeling something similar the last two days.*  My therapist recommended a book about reassurance seeking that has helped me recognize these sorts of situations. It’s called “Needing to Know for Sure” by Seif and Winston. I’m not sure if there are non-English versions of the book or if there is a translation to your native language, but I listened to the audiobook and found it useful to have words to describe what was happening. I absolutely recommend it if it’s accessible to you.   We have all sorts of different triggers that cause us to get caught in these “traps,” as the book calls them. They look like what you’re describing - a worry you can’t ease, questions you can’t answer, answers you don’t feel satisfied by. For me, and likely most people on this subreddit, certain social things are one of the triggers. It’s super uncomfortable to find yourself circling around something you did or maybe chose not to do and evaluating it over and over. And it’s exhausting, it’s so consuming; I understand your feelings and I feel for you because I experience this too.   “Did I mistreat them? Did they think I was weird? Do they hate me now?” It’s so hard because we’re caught in a situation where we find it almost impossible to know for sure and the uncertainty feels unbearable, sometimes physically painful. The first part of finding your way out of this loop is to know when you’re in it. I know this sounds counterintuitive, but the way out is *not* through certainty, it is not through knowing or asking more questions, that just pushes us deeper into the trap.   And it sounds silly, but I usually say to myself out loud, “I’m caught in a reassurance trap. I want to know for sure that they like me and that my behavior did not make them uncomfortable. I’m asking myself and others if this is true, but no one has the answer, not even myself.” I say out loud, “I’m feeling discomfort from uncertainty and it sucks. I don’t like feeling like this, so it makes sense that I want this feeling to go away. The way out, is to let go and accept I cannot know for sure.” Then I take deep breaths and repeat the process if I need to. It’s scary, but it’s true. The questions like this come, it’s normal. The way to avoid the trap is to acknowledge them and choose to not answer them. “Thank you for the questions, brain, but seeking answers will not bring me peace. This discomfort is temporary and will pass.”  I know this sounds like some frou-frou BS, but with practice, it does ease the mental pain. We don’t work at it for mastery, we just use each opportunity as practice.   I feel for you and I appreciate your vulnerability in sharing this.

"Hi, I have been a sufferer of PTSD for many years, but diagnosed 12yrs ago. Now a caveat, I am not trained to diagnose. Therefore, my first advice is go and get an assessment by a qualified clinical psychologist, there are many things this could be, self diagnosis and treatment can cause more problems. That said, regardless of the diagnosis, the symptoms you are describing is likely to be a release of chemicals in your body which can effect many systems. This can then lead to panic attack, anxiety, fight or flight (I call it up or down). That way I know if I'm up, I have to calm down and vice versa. How? burn those chemicals off, go for a walk, count your steps as you go, every 50 steps, stop, take 2 deep breaths, go again. Look around you, find something you have never noticed before. , keep walking, keep breathing, be aware of your steps, be aware of your breathing.

"I've actually been lifting since I was 14, and I'm reading a lot about ED because of my daughter, but it seems like I actually exhibit a lot of the characteristics of ED, but the one main distinction is that I set goals. I've been doing the gain/cut cycle like other weight lifters and body builders, for over 30 years. During gain, I would eat a lot of carbs. During cut, I would cut out carbs, eat a lot of protein, and do absolutely no aerobic workouts. I guess the other big difference is I didn't purge. Not that I never thought about it after eating more than I can eat at a buffet. I just never actually tried or done it.  Like I said, it it wasn't for my end goals, what I've been doing for about 30 years of my life could be considered ED. I don't gain/cut anymore. I'm too old. I just eat balanced, and exercise. So my suggestion is maybe setting goals. For gain, my goals were how much I could lift. My main thing was bench press. So I would set a goal of gaining 50 pounds on bench. I would gain roughly 5 pounds a week, so I would meet my goal in about 10-12 weeks. I wouldn't cut right away. I would wait about a month for things to stabilize. But then I would cut. I would set goals, and when I met my goal, I would again just let things settle and stabilize for a few months. I really liked the way I looked after cutting, so I wouldn't gain right away. But eventually, I would feel like I was weak and needed to get stronger, so I would start the cycle again.  Anyways, I'm very obsessive and intense. I don't really do things half way. Everything is full throttle 100%. There would be times that I'm eating two boiled eggs for breakfast, and imitation crab meat and avocado for lunch, for like 8 weeks straight, and my co-workers thought I was nuts.",EatingDisorders,positive,ive actually lifting since 14 im reading lot ed daughter seems like actually exhibit lot characteristic ed one main distinction set goal ive gaincut cycle like weight lifter body builder 30 year gain would eat lot carbs cut would cut carbs eat lot protein absolutely aerobic workout guess big difference didnt purge never thought eating eat buffet never actually tried done like said wasnt end goal ive 30 year life could considered ed dont gaincut anymore im old eat balanced exercise suggestion maybe setting goal gain goal much could lift main thing bench press would set goal gaining 50 pound bench would gain roughly 5 pound week would meet goal 1012 week wouldnt cut right away would wait month thing stabilize would cut would set goal met goal would let thing settle stabilize month really liked way looked cutting wouldnt gain right away eventually would feel like weak needed get stronger would start cycle anyways im obsessive intense dont really thing half way everything full throttle 100 would time im eating two boiled egg breakfast imitation crab meat avocado lunch like 8 week straight coworkers thought nut,SUBJECTIVE

"Been there, kind of there now, and every now and then, I find myself back to this issue—  Because depression forces you away from everything you love for so long, it feels overwhelming to get back into anything. It really sucks the joy out of hobbies and it becomes hard to know if you ever really enjoyed those things to begin with, and sometimes trying to get back into them also feels impossible.  I’d say revisiting old memories is one way to rediscover your personality. Cleaning out your room for example, I find that cleaning sometimes helps me feel productive and also helps me put my thoughts in order. You can look through old things, stuff you kept around, things you collected, photographs, read old notes or diaries if you kept those.  Or if you don’t have any of that or don’t want to, look for something new to try. Maybe go to the dollar store/pound shop and look around, see if anything catches your eye. It can be puzzles, colouring books, toys, hell a candle making kit- doesn’t matter how childish it might seem, sometimes you have to appeal to your inner child to find little bits of joy.  If that’s too overwhelming, find a movie/series/anime to watch.

"The medications help with both honestly. When I was younger with SA I would sweat, shake, feel nauseous, stutter, couldn't make eye contact, tear up, etc. I absolutely could not function socially, personally, professionally. I grew out of that with a lot of time and experiences, but as an adult I still feel SA in terms of calling out of work or social functions often. At company dinners, I barely manage to get myself there and when there I stand there awkwardly and wish I never went the entire time. I feel awkward when people interact with me and I'm constantly feeling like I'm not doing well. I get a fast heart rate and occasional nausea still.  However, with my meds I don't have those behaviors anymore. I don't feel any symptoms of SA physically, but it also affected me emotionally. I don't think 3 sentences at all times anymore. I'm able to approach people and be approached-- although, still very awkward LOL I'm working on it. Because my thoughts and emotions are much more ""quiet,"" I don't get hung up over rejections. I went to a group social thing for example where everyone came with someone but I was alone and new. I said hi how are you, made eye contact, and they ignored me. I don't feel any personal feelings about it though, it's just whatever and onto the next group LOL. Before, it would take me weeks to recover from that as I would think about it and cringe and cry and feel so upset. I probably would also never try it again because I'd feel like I was the issue, rather than the unfriendly people.

"I think sometimes with depression there isn’t anything to really say. Sometimes, when someone tries to relate to your low point (to your very depressed mind) it can come across as ‘piling on’ or ‘one upping’. Same thing with trying to be optimistic and saying things like ‘it gets better!’ or ‘you’re amazing’, it feels like it’s minimalising the issues or even sometimes feels fake. Beware of something called ‘toxic positivity’- that’s where people sometimes accidentally try to navigate heavy situations by pushing optimistic views or words. It can feel discouraging, like no one understands and isolates the depressed person.  Mostly, depression is painful because your own mind is your enemy. You understand that people are sometimes trying to help, as I’m sure your brother understands and even appreciates you for putting the effort in. It’s just hard for him to truly accept things like ‘it’s going to be okay’ because in that moment his mind is probably going ‘yeah, right, nothing is okay, it never gets better’.  The best thing to do is listen, I think. Try to be close, try to offer distraction, things like suggesting an outing to somewhere you know he enjoys, or even having some downtime with an indoor movie session, or whatever you guys bond over. These little joys can really make a big difference in pulling people back from the edge.  And finally, thank you for being there.

"I was like that , but one day I just thought of simplifying the calculation, didn't count every ingredient, just the ones with the highest calorie density. For example, if I ate 1 pound chicken salad ( including the leafs and vegetables), I would just take the calorie intake of 1 pound of chicken. About 85-90 % of the time the calculation comes out to be more than the actual calories of the food , which also creates an ever so slightly calorie deficit. I also like some suggestions about not counting calories at all , but in my case I was not able to give that up , it was always I can't eat everything willy nilly and also can't spend my whole day just trying to figure out how much I ate .  One more suggestion is be kind to yourself when you mess up . For example think of your friend trying to do the same and messes by eating fried chicken, will you immediately assume and forget all the progress they have made till now , no , right? Why is that ?When we can show so much compassion for others yet we fall short on treating ourselves well. These might be some of the reasons why we might have EDs , but remember being kind and forgiving yourself is not such a bad thing after all , it's fine to have a good meal once in a while , something we enjoy . In today's scenario it's almost impossible to predict what we'll eat at any given time as understandably in social settings we can't just sit there and refuse to eat everything, similarly when hanging out with your SO you'd want to spend a good time , you can't do that when you always stick to rules set up by yourself .

"I’m so sorry your family is going through all of this, my son has schizophrenia it’s so hard.  I think the best first step as someone else suggested would be to apply for temporary guardianship. This will allow the doctors to speak with you and discuss his care. An AOT (assisted outpatient treatment) order may also be a good idea. This is a court ordered treatment plan. It will outline what services he will get and the medication he is required to take because unfortunately even when you are his guardian you aren’t allowed to make take psychiatric medication. The best time to apply for this is really when he’s in the psych hospital. They should hold him there until the order is issued and all his service lined up. My son has an AOT order and gets services from an ACT (assertive community treatment) team. They come to our house to see him, bring his medication weekly and psych NP comes to discuss his medication and a nurse comes to administer his LAI (long acting injectable).     I would also recommend seeing if you can get him on clozapine. It’s generally prescribed for treatment resistant schizophrenia and has really worked wonders for my son. One of the difficulties is he will need weekly blood monitoring for the first six months and twice a month for six months after that. But it really is an amazing medication. You may have a difficult time getting the doctors to prescribe it because it can be more work for them but push for it, it’s worth it. This is one reason the guardianship is SO important. I feel like if the hospitals know someone is paying attention and really involved in their care they are a little less likely  to try and shove them out the door as quickly as possible.  When he’s admitted find out who his social worker is they will be your contact person during his stay. Call them regularly and ask to speak often about what his discharge plan will be. I’m not sure but I believe there is always supposed to be a discharge plan in place before he is released.     I feel like I’m getting ahead of myself here. 1st step guardianship, 2nd step get him admitted to a psych facility so you know he’s safe. While he’s there make noise! Tell them you want the AOT order you want ACT team services. Research what’s available in your area and ask for as much as you can so you can hopefully at least get what you need. (Mental health services are in such short supply in this country.) Tell them also you want him to have a case manager / care coordinator, they should be able to direct you to and link you up with available services in your area.They should also be able to help you apply for things like disability and Medicaid It’s really best to try and do these things while he’s committed if possible. Applying for the AOT order helps for the other reason too that since it has to go through the court so can sometimes take awhile thereby keeping him in the hospital.      One last thing I’ve found somewhat helpful when calling the police is to lead with the fact he’s mentally ill and he needs to go for a psych eval. Stress that as much as you can and if the situation is safe enough downplay the behavior that’s making you call and reinforce the fact that he’s ill and needs treatment. Some areas have officers trained to help in these situations (I forget exactly what they are called) but try asking for one of them. I know depending on how dangerous the situation is this isn’t always possible.     I hope at least some of this is helpful to you. I know what you’re going through and it’s so difficult,and often feels so very isolating. We had the worst year of our lives last year and this year has been the best since he got sick 7 years ago. Things can change.  It’s most likely going to be a  fight for everything he needs and he’s very lucky to have you and your mom in his corner to help him.   I wish you and your family all the best.  Please make sure you and your mom take care of yourselves, it’s so easy to forget that when all this is happening.",schizophrenia,positive,i ’ m sorry family going son schizophrenia it ’ s hard think best first step someone else suggested would apply temporary guardianship allow doctor speak discus care aot assisted outpatient treatment order may also good idea court ordered treatment plan outline service get medication required take unfortunately even guardian aren ’ t allowed make take psychiatric medication best time apply really he ’ s psych hospital hold order issued service lined son aot order get service act assertive community treatment team come house see bring medication weekly psych np come discus medication nurse come administer lai long acting injectable would also recommend seeing get clozapine it ’ s generally prescribed treatment resistant schizophrenia really worked wonder son one difficulty need weekly blood monitoring first six month twice month six month really amazing medication may difficult time getting doctor prescribe work push it ’ s worth one reason guardianship important feel like hospital know someone paying attention really involved care little le likely try shove door quickly possible he ’ s admitted find social worker contact person stay call regularly ask speak often discharge plan i ’ m sure believe always supposed discharge plan place released feel like i ’ m getting ahead 1st step guardianship 2nd step get admitted psych facility know he ’ s safe he ’ s make noise tell want aot order want act team service research what ’ s available area ask much hopefully least get need mental health service short supply country tell also want case manager care coordinator able direct link available service areathey also able help apply thing like disability medicaid it ’ s really best try thing he ’ s committed possible applying aot order help reason since go court sometimes take awhile thereby keeping hospital one last thing i ’ ve found somewhat helpful calling police lead fact he ’ s mentally ill need go psych eval stress much situation safe enough downplay behavior that ’ s making call reinforce fact he ’ s ill need treatment area officer trained help situation forget exactly called try asking one know depending dangerous situation isn ’ t always possible hope least helpful know you ’ re going it ’ s difficultand often feel isolating worst year life last year year best since got sick 7 year ago thing change it ’ s likely going fight everything need he ’ s lucky mom corner help wish family best please make sure mom take care it ’ s easy forget happening,SUBJECTIVE

"Mate I assume you don’t wanna read a paragraph so here’s some goals to set for yourself   1) Ween yourself off of porn, dont go cold turkey.

"I used to have extremely vivid very violent dreams where it was kill or be killed type scenarios that included loved ones ect. so very personal and graphic, downright disturbing. For about 10 years these dreams plagued me until I learned that dreaming is basically your brain unpacking and sorting stimulus and experiences, anxieties. Your brain is also healing and processing physical stuff which in turn might influence dreaming. So everytime I had a horrible nightmare Id start talking to myself about how this is just my brain sorting it all out, its messy.  I started to notice that Id have violent dreams after being exposed to violence somehow, like my brain was processing the  violence during sleep. I started cut out media that contained violence and explicit violent details and it paid off.  The less I feed myself nightmare fuel like gore stories/shows (SAW movies ect) the less violence happened in my dreams. So I just accept a bad dream when I wake up as it being a functional brain thing that I can opt out of giving any weight or credit to in terms of it being or meaning anything at all except brain processing. I understand that and keep my exposure to nightmare fuel minimal and now its rare af for me to have a violent dream, maybe once every couple years instead of every couple of weeks.   When I do have one it disturbs me only in the sense that when you first wake up it all still kinda feels real, but I talk myself through it. Its just brain stuff.

"From your description it sounds like you might have bipolar tendencies (not a doctor, just sounds like it to me)  In manic episode you'll feel high with different beliefs about yourself (you're suddenly a hero or imbued with a special destiny) and want to do crazy things like driving real fast, learn to swim in a river or gamble. Usually followed by depressive episodes where you feel lethargic, sad, angry and sometimes suicidal. So if you have the possibility to reach out to a healthcare professional, definitely do it. Even if it's just a general practitioner. It doesn't have to be that hard. And your insurance might cover the costs.  Addictions are very tricky to get over, and it's usually caused by underlying problems. It takes more than just deciding to stop to actually stop. From what you describe it could be some sort of loneliness, which is far too common and a lot more serious than what we give it credit for. Take it easy with porn. Yes it's not a great industry and it feels bad being dependent. But if you need this to stay afloat at the moment I'd recommend to focus on other areas of your life first before even attempting to reduce your consumption. Find yourself nice people to hang out with. Start learning a language, an instrument, start a sport... I've been there, new country, a bit lost, and I wish I had done that sooner.  I understand that your first sexual contact was not what you expected for yourself, and I'm sorry about that. But again, there's a lot of fuss about first times and all that sort of thing.

"I've been diagnosed ADHD since I was 8, and have never once doubted my diagnosis. My stimulants affected me positively (concerta at first, Adderall for a brief stint, then Vyvanse), and helped with my negative symptoms that have always been my biggest struggle since my schizophrenia developed around ages 10-15. I've always responded typically to stimulants, in a very textbook way, and that combined with just generally fitting most every common ADHD experience means I have full confidence, yes I do have co-morbid ADHD and schizophrenia.   In contrast, I was diagnosed with autism when I was 16, and have always doubted it, because why did I suddenly ""become autistic"" in the past few years? And while I've identified with autistic experiences, they were always ADHD or schizophrenic experiences, too. I've just realized I got off topic, I'm so sorry, let me try again.   I have been off stimulants for most of my 20s, and my positive symptoms have actually gotten worse. But there's also a lot of scientific evidence that suggest the 20s is just a time where some people's brains get worse, so I wouldn't necessarily say they're related, but you're free to draw your own conclusions. I never really noticed my positive symptoms being better or worse on days I would forget my stimulant, but I also only recently realized my ""eyes playing tricks on me"" constantly have been hallucinations, so my memory may not be reliable. Not the greatest data, but it's data, yeah? My psychosis is constant, but so are my negative symptoms, and I've honestly never struggled with my psychosis as much as the negative symptoms.

"You can't know for sure, which is why you shouldn't spend time overanalysing something. If it wasn't said directly to you, you shouldn't worry about it! If anyone had a real problem with you, it's only something worth considering if they actually make the effot to confront you.   If you want a CBT approach, it would be helpful to jot down whenever you have these irrational thoughts. Maybe at the end of the day or whenever you can, look back on them and rate each thought from 1-100% with your belief in it (100% being you believe it entirely.)  Then, preferably with an other person to help, try to come up with a more realistic interpretation, and again rate your belief in that. Once you've done that, go back to your original irrational thought, and rate it again.   Gaming is very mainstream now.

"Hi I hope that this will help you. I completely understand your situation and depression can feel like this looming shadow that never quite goes away, and the fear of it returning can be overwhelming at times. But please know that you're not alone in feeling this way.
 I've been through similar struggles myself, and I know how terrifying it can be to face those memories and fears head-on. However, I've found that with time and the right support, it's possible to regain a sense of normalcy and control over your life.
   
   One thing that really helped me through those tough times was finding [effective self-care strategies](https://careclinic.io/depression-self-care-checklist/) it honestly became a lifeline for me. By incorporating some of the tips and techniques suggested, like practicing mindfulness, establishing a routine, and reaching out for support when needed, I started to feel more empowered and capable of managing my mental health.
   
   Of course, everyone's journey is different, and what works for me may not work for other. But I encourage you to explore these self-care practices and see if any resonate with you.

"At the very least, just make it clear that talking about restricting food and over exercising does not impress you. Ignore those comments, change the subject, or say that those comments are concerning to hear. Do not enable this behavior for social graces. Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t care if it’s uncomfortable to talk about. Anorexia is the deadliest mental illness and deserves to be addressed directly. With that said, it should be handled delicately of course. Commenting on their body can be very triggering, so avoid saying you’ve noticed weight loss or anything like that. Avoid any body comments at all, good, bad, or neutral.  I’m thinking it thru, but some ideas: “It concerns me when you talk about how little food you eat. Our culture glamorizes restriction and that’s super unhealthy and can lead to things like eating disorders.” If you have personal experience: “I had a friend who had an ED and what you’re saying sounds like her, which makes me worried.” Or “I used to struggle with restriction and what you’re saying kind of sounds like that. Do you think it might be the same thing?”  Keep in mind that people who are sick can be very stuck in denial and become defensive if you encourage them to face reality. Even if you handle it perfectly, they may get upset, be uncomfortable, or still not do anything about it. But at least you can feel grounded in knowing you tried, and maybe you planted a seed. Just be honest and direct, but kind and curious. Be confident in knowing that you’re doing the right thing and it’s ok to ask important questions and be honest about your concerns.

At first I didn't really mind the weight gain, but some days are hard. I try to just keep my mind off it by doing other things.

"Perspective coming from (25f) 10 years experience in eating disorder recovery. Also in school to be a professional counselor—specifically art therapist. I have been in and out of treatment all levels of care.   Ahhh yes, you are not alone unfortunately in this struggle. Many women and men have been conditioned to view food as numbers and our bodies as something we are to fear and not trust. This may be rooted in fat-phobia and diet-culture but the reality is that fat people have always existed and health does come in all sizes. You can be overweight and have a completely healthy relationship with food and lab results. Weight alone is not a great or reliable indicator of health and genetics often plays the biggest role anyways.   Calorie counting is disguised as a health promoting behavior by diet-culture when in reality restriction and monitoring every bite you eat and tracking intake breeds an unnatural, obsessive, and disordered relationship with food.   I do not know how long you have been struggling or your age or if you have a good support system or are willing to take that step to seek out treatment and support which is available btw!  Bad news— it’s very difficult to re-wire our brains and likely will take time, support (like professional support and evidenced based treatments such as CBT and DBT specific designed for OCD, depression and eating disorders), and trial and error. Just two years even I was still not in a great spot and associating food with numbers despite years of trying to unlearn this behavior.   The reality is, this behavior is often reinforced by society due to diet-culture and calories are plastered everywhere and on menus making going out to eat an even more anxiety provoking experience for many. That’s why treatment programs and support groups are also available and intuitive eating groups as well. Having supportive mealtime and group therapy with ppl going through the same thing can be so therapeutic in the right environment!   Good news- we CAN RE-wire our brains due to neuroplasticity. After consistently working on my self and with the right support and treatment team I was able to unlearn a lot of my cognitive distortions, challenge my food fears, and unlearn associating food with a stupid number and viewing food for what it is: food and fuel, family, connection, joy, culture, being alive. Rather than viewing food as “good” vs “bad” or a stupid number.  Working with intuitive eating dieticians throughout the years helped me to work on relationship with food and body. Food rules and restriction literally disconnect us from our bodies and eating experiences and natural hunger fullness cues. Restriction literally disrupts and disregulated the nervous system and disregulated hunger fullness cues.   That’s why in the beginning intuitive eating can feel counter intuitive because you may have to force yourself to eat when you’re not hungry because until you’re nervous system gets regulated again with regulated meals— you can’t trust ya hunger cues ironically because the restriction disregulated it so you may not feel hungry but ya body still needs more than what you were giving it. Once it regulates with consistent regulated meals (3 meals a day and snacks) your hunger fullness cues will regulate again and you can start to work on the intuitive and trusting your body part.   Help is available, I could recover on my own with no support and there is a specific treatment for eating disorders as it is a specialty in the field.",EatingDisorders,positive,perspective coming 25f 10 year experience eating disorder recovery also school professional counselor—specifically art therapist treatment level care ahhh yes alone unfortunately struggle many woman men conditioned view food number body something fear trust may rooted fatphobia dietculture reality fat people always existed health come size overweight completely healthy relationship food lab result weight alone great reliable indicator health genetics often play biggest role anyways calorie counting disguised health promoting behavior dietculture reality restriction monitoring every bite eat tracking intake breed unnatural obsessive disordered relationship food know long struggling age good support system willing take step seek treatment support available btw bad news— it ’ s difficult rewire brain likely take time support like professional support evidenced based treatment cbt dbt specific designed ocd depression eating disorder trial error two year even still great spot associating food number despite year trying unlearn behavior reality behavior often reinforced society due dietculture calorie plastered everywhere menu making going eat even anxiety provoking experience many that ’ s treatment program support group also available intuitive eating group well supportive mealtime group therapy ppl going thing therapeutic right environment good news rewire brain due neuroplasticity consistently working self right support treatment team able unlearn lot cognitive distortion challenge food fear unlearn associating food stupid number viewing food food fuel family connection joy culture alive rather viewing food “ good ” v “ bad ” stupid number working intuitive eating dietician throughout year helped work relationship food body food rule restriction literally disconnect u body eating experience natural hunger fullness cue restriction literally disrupts disregulated nervous system disregulated hunger fullness cue that ’ s beginning intuitive eating feel counter intuitive may force eat you ’ re hungry you ’ re nervous system get regulated regulated meals— can ’ t trust ya hunger cue ironically restriction disregulated may feel hungry ya body still need giving regulates consistent regulated meal 3 meal day snack hunger fullness cue regulate start work intuitive trusting body part help available could recover support specific treatment eating disorder specialty field,SUBJECTIVE

"Hi  Sorry your going through a difficult time.  It can get better and it takes many things to achieve it.  A proper assessment and doing what the psychiatrist recommends  is a great place to start if your prescribed meds take them as prescribed  and stick with it, antidepressants take awhile to start working so you have to give them a good chance and take them everyday.  Therapy can also help a great deal and again you have to be willing to give it a good try and stick with it and go to the appointments Including trying to do the things they recommend at home.  It is just not see a doctor here are some meds and you will be fine.  Set yourself small realistic goals so you don't get over-whelmed maybe start with hygiene and spending a few minutes outside and if your up to go for a short walk.   If your room needs to be cleaned maybe add that to list start in one area and do a bit each day if your able to.  There will be set back and struggles but the better you do at breaking the routine your in now the better you start to feel and the meds and therapy also help with the bad days.  Therapy helps with negative thoughts, gives you strategies to use when your struggling and can help with motivation.

It gives us confidence. Activity, especially physical activity, is a kind of therapy. That's not all there is to getting over depression, but it can be very important.

I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor include how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  The lockdown has changed the therapy situation. You may want to look at online therapy and self-help. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.  Some places have free therapy. A doctor or social worker may be able to help you with a search for therapy.  If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.  People in various countries say that they can often find the books I mention in my comments with Amazon, Kindle, or Google Books.  If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Steve Ilardi's book (""a splendid book""). He's the therapist and researcher who headed the Univ of Kansas lifestyle-depression project.  Relaxation eases the symptoms of depression.  The easiest way to calm down is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently through the nose, 6 seconds each.  A good habit - respond to moments of stress by breathing slowly.

"You both need therapy, there’s a lot of online options. I can relate to your situation because I’m kinda going through it now, although my mother is not dead yet but she is sick. I honestly wouldn’t feel much pain from it but my sister probably would be devastated. You just got back to her life after so many years, and she only heard your parents side of the story. Little by little start gettjng close to her, this week have dinner with her, next week go out to eat, watch a movie or just talk about random stuff really. She’s grieving so coming out of her shell will be hard.  About the ED, you can’t just force her now to start eating as normal. She threw out the food because she’s scared of it, she doesn’t want to see it, my other sister with an ED used to do the same. When you cook, don’t fill you guyses plates, or use small plates to give it the illusion that is not much food. Also don’t cook complicated stuff that you put lots of stuff in the plate, like rice meat and salad. Start with a salad and meat, stuff like that. You also need to know her fear foods, but for that you need to gain her trust first.  Try to have meals with her at least once per day, and even if she doesn’t want to talk, try to distract her but within her boundaries I know that it’s a lot of stuff, that’s how it is when the person needs to learn how to eat well again. Don’t worry, you both going to therapy and all this you will be able to make it, you and your sister.

"Parenting isn't mentoring and helping out. At first it's basic care and affection. Then it's creating a safe space for your child to explore the world in. More and more it becomes about mentoring your child but also setting limits and boundaries for safe discovery. Then more and more it's about letting them discover on their own while still being there to support them when they need it. And then it's letting go of the boundaries and letting them set them on their own and it's trying to keep the relationship strong despite their growing independence.   It all happens across years and years. You've got time to learn each stage. You've got resources. It's something you'll have to learn and relearn every year or so.

Yes therapy for your girlfriend. But other than that my partner was sa’d for like 10 years by a family member when she was little. My partner isn’t as affected as your partner is. I suggest playing music pretty loud so that your partner can focus on that instead of the sounds. Also turn the lights off until your partner asks for them to be on. Let her lead sometimes and also make it very clear what you do like for her to do. When you like something tell her she’s amazing and awesome. Make it a very positive environment. Also. Never make her clean the bed. Let her lay on the couch or make a snack while you strip the bed and never make her sleep on a bed without a sheet. Often that’s the scariest thing for my partner because she would be in the room still while he stripped the bed. The main thing she remembers is staring at the bare mattress. Make sure everytime you make a move in the bedroom that you’re asking her if she is comfortable. I also suggest making a safe word incase she gets scared or uncomfortable and wants it to stop immediately. She needs comfort after the bedroom if she is comfortable with touching and cuddling after. While your partner goes to therapy make sure it’s after a couple of sessions and she feels confident in her therapist. Ask to go to a session to really grasp what triggers your partner. These triggers are an absolute must. They must never be ignored and you have to commit it to memory. If you mess up with these triggers your partner will loose trust in you sexually very quickly.

"I guess I’d need more info about your daily food intake and habits to say anything concrete or helpful, but I have a hunch. I’m also 29 and have had every type of eating disorder almost since I was in middle school. I was also in an IOP treatment program for 6 years in my 20s. So take this all with a grain of salt, I’ve only observed things, I’m not a professional at all.   From what I noticed through all my intensive therapy (we had hours of group therapy per week with other people and all EDs you can think of), people who thought they only struggled with binge eating were ignoring the fact that they were actually just trapped in a binge-restrict cycle that reinforced the binge part. The bingeing for these people would cause them to want to diet and restrict after a period of bingeing, and they’d try that restriction for as long as they could because Health! Which makes sense, that’s what the medical industry says fat people should do.   And then they would lapse back into bingeing seemingly out of nowhere after a period of dieting, even if it was a short length of time. They didn’t understand that most of the bingeing was actually a symptom of the periods of restriction and deprivation. It teaches your body that because it will have these stretches of dieting and “starvation”, it needs to eat as much as possible when food is available. I’d say almost every binge eater in my groups that I encountered struggled with repeated attempts to control their weight and eating and weight cycling. The therapists, dieticians and nurse practitioners leading these groups tried to show us (with peer reviewed citations) that dieting/deprivation trains your body and brain to see food as something to binge on, it becomes almost a reflex.  I don’t know the details of their treatment one on one with their assigned therapists and dieticians, but in group I gathered a first step for the people with binge eating, regardless of their weight, was to focus on eating a full balanced day of food every single day, no dieting or calorie restriction whatsoever. The goal can’t be to lose weight, it’s gotta be to prove to your body that you’re safe, it’ll get good when it’s hungry, reliably, always, and doesn’t need to go nuts and eat the entire pack of cookies anytime it gets access to enjoyable food.   It’s also about reconnecting with your body since binge eaters tend the describe bingeing as almost an out of body experience and like they’re in a trance. So when you’re eating 3 meals and 3 snacks in a nutritional and structured way (it’s called mechanical eating and there are example online for eating disorders), they also encourage anyone with an ED to do so mindfully. Like eat slowly if you can, not crazy slowly but slow enough to shift in your chair, notice how your body feels while you’re eating, taking pauses to sip on your water or juice or whatever, notice how your food looks, tastes, feels, etc. check in with how full you are at each point in your meal. There are YouTube videos you can listen along with (it’s called “mindful eating”) while you’re eating for help with your own meals.   That’s just my two cents!

"I have/had both an Apple Watch and a Fitbit. I enjoy my watch for some aspects. I like tracking my steps along with a few other things like getting notifications and texting. However, my eating disorder becomes 10x worse whenever I’m very actively using it. I find my Fitbit to be worse than my Apple Watch because of the food logging in the Fitbit. I tend to start restricting heavily again and become obsessed with the calories burned number. The calories burned on the Apple Watch also affects me quite a bit and I’ll start to workout too much to meet my goal number even though I know those numbers are extremely inaccurate.   I’ve had friends get rid of their fitness trackers for similar reasons, but I also have friends who’ve had great success with them.

"you seem to have body dysmorphia. I had it too. and I am male. society doesnt even expect me to be that pretty and i still had it so you can imagine how fucked up my mind was.  I remember skipping work and visiting 3-4 plastic surgeons and 7-8 orthodontists over the the course of 2 months.  One day i had a breakdown. I started crying infront of my mom. Although it was embarassing thats when i realized i needed mental help not plastic surgery.  I visited psychiatrists and all they did was prescribed me meds. They helped a bit but once you get on meds and dont make behavorial changes, you will stay stuck with meds forever.  to make lasting change to how you feel, you gotta make behavorial changes  okay so talk about behavorial changes.  the advice i am going to give is not sexy but its the only thing that works for mental health issues like this (compulsively thinking about something, obsessing over something)  I read books after books after books on how to treat myself.  earlier when the thought of my cheeks being sunk striked my mind, I used to either go check the mirror or try to justify to myself that my cheeks are okay.  but any type of interaction with the thought is harmful. when you interact with such thoughts, you basically tell the brain that this thought is important. thats why it keeps bring ing it up to you.  what i started doing was (as was told to me in these books) acknowledge the thought but didnt interact with it. There was a strong urge to either go to the toilet to check myself in the mirror or to ruminate but i didnt do it. I either started focusing on the sensations in my body or focus on work (if that is what I was doing when the thought arose)  Initially i felt a lot of anxiety when i didnt engage with thought. that is expected to happen though. But over time it went down, my brain learned that the thought about my cheeks was not that important and rarely brings it up now.  mind you this whole things took 3 years to reach this stage.  read books about acceptance and commitment therapy and exposure therapy",depression,positive,seem body dysmorphia male society doesnt even expect pretty still imagine fucked mind remember skipping work visiting 34 plastic surgeon 78 orthodontist course 2 month one day breakdown started cry infront mom although embarassing thats realized needed mental help plastic surgery visited psychiatrist prescribed med helped bit get med dont make behavorial change stay stuck med forever make lasting change feel got ta make behavorial change okay talk behavorial change advice going give sexy thing work mental health issue like compulsively thinking something obsessing something read book book book treat earlier thought cheek sunk striked mind used either go check mirror try justify cheek okay type interaction thought harmful interact thought basically tell brain thought important thats keep bring ing started told book acknowledge thought didnt interact strong urge either go toilet check mirror ruminate didnt either started focusing sensation body focus work thought arose initially felt lot anxiety didnt engage thought expected happen though time went brain learned thought cheek important rarely brings mind whole thing took 3 year reach stage read book acceptance commitment therapy exposure therapy,SUBJECTIVE

"I'm in a similar situation. I wasn't diagnosed till I was 19, but I've definitely had social anxiety since I was 14. I'm in the same boat, never been to a party, didn't date till I was 21, and don't really have friends. Not much to do about the past, but you mentioned wanting to get to a position where you're socially 'normal', and I can offer a little advice on that.   Just to start off, I have limited experience with psychologists and therapy, and that's probably the best option in terms of getting to a position where you're socially 'normal'.   Also, I'm writing this part after I finished writing the whole reply and want to say, sorry for the long reply. The long story short is, I started by talking to bookstore employees about books, than talking to other customers at the bookstore, usually starting convos complimenting people's shirts. And sorry if this isn't the reply you were looking for, I wasn't sure, but thought it wouldn't hurt.   That said, if you want more details, here it goes. Before the pandemic, I got pretty close to 'socially normal', and  if the pandemic never happened, I feel like I'd be in a much better place.  Given that you're making goals to talk to people, it sounds like you're in a similar place I was when I was 21, in 2019. I wanted to talk to people, but my anxiety was holding me back.   I slowly started pushing myself out of my comfort zone, making goals, like your goal to spark up a convo in class. I feel like talking to people in class may be too big a step. For me, going from someone who never talks in class, to initiating a convo in class would be too far out of my comfort zone, and it might be better to start smaller.   I started by going to a book store with the goal of asking an employee for a recommendation. Now, I wasn't much of a reader, and I honestly never read the books I bought, but it did help my get started. I walked in with a plan. I practiced what I was gonna say to predictable questions like, ""what are some books you like?"" I would say, ""Honestly, I've never been much of a reader, but recently I've been interested in starting.""   So, the first time I went it was too busy and I never saw an employee walking around so I left. Next time I went at a not so busy time, walked around the sci fi/fantasy aisle a while, and when eventually an employee walked by, I asked for a recommendation, and they didn't ask me anything, and just grabbed a book in the aisle I was in, talked about it, and I just bought it, knowing it wasn't something I'd like. Now, even though I didn't intend on reading these, I thought it'd be better if I said I wasn't interested, rather than just nodding and buying it. So next time I went to a different book store, after practicing how I would say no to the first recommendation. This time they asked a few questions first, and we had a whole convo about books, it was definitely a little awkward, but in the end, I walked out feeling better about talking to people. I went to the bookstore a few more times, always talking to different employees.   I feel like this is a good place to start because it's low pressure, and generally bookstore employees like books, and like talking about books. For me, this was definitely a little outside my comfort zone at first, but became easier each time.   Next, I started convos with other customers at the book store, usually start by saying, ""I like your shirt."" And if they seemed interested in talking more, I'd ask them what kind of books they're looking for. Or one time this girl had a pin for a game I like on her purse, and we talked about the game.  After a month, I got comfortable talking to strangers one on one at the bookstore, and I could carry a convo pretty well.   After this I took a big step and joined a dating site, but I don't think I'd recommend this. It was good for me, but I don't think it's for everyone.   However, bumble has an option for friend finding, and that might be a good way of making friends when you're ready for that.   I do want to say, that it really depends on your mental state. Back then, I was feeling better, so this worked for me. Now that the pandemic has made my social anxiety worse than ever, this wouldn't work for me at all. Hope you find a way to get where you want to be. Good luck!

"It’s so great that you care and that you’ve noticed and that you’re seeking help for her. She is lucky to have you in her life.   It is complicated to recover from an eating disorder as there are many different reasons why they happen and she will almost certainly need professional support to get well again. I don’t know who you should best contact but someone who is closest to her like a parent, probably needs to be told as she’ll need someone who’s a full adult to help her access a health professional ?  Usually people start with their family doctor, GP, PCP, whatever you call them and usually they refer to whatever is the best service. There are also many different organisations that can help like Beat, which is a U.K. eating disorder charity. But wherever you live there may be others. It may take some time to get her the help she needs from medical staff, so also seeking help from other organisations in the mean time is a good idea. So I recommend seeking a charity who could help in the meantime.   What you can personally do is probably just to tell her that you love her, however she looks, that you will love her whatever weight or size she is, that you don’t mind because you love her as she is, for the person that she is, not for her appearance. She might not fully believe you but it might help a bit.   Being with someone who has repeatedly said that to me has really helped me to recover from my eating disorder. But it’s unlikely to be enough on its own.   She may be reluctant for you to tell family or friends, so you’ll have to judge who could be told and probably discuss with her about who can be told.   So doctor + charities + parent ?, reassurance from you.",EatingDisorders,positive,it ’ s great care you ’ ve noticed you ’ re seeking help lucky life complicated recover eating disorder many different reason happen almost certainly need professional support get well don ’ t know best contact someone closest like parent probably need told she ’ ll need someone who ’ s full adult help access health professional usually people start family doctor gp pcp whatever call usually refer whatever best service also many different organisation help like beat uk eating disorder charity wherever live may others may take time get help need medical staff also seeking help organisation mean time good idea recommend seeking charity could help meantime personally probably tell love however look love whatever weight size don ’ t mind love person appearance might fully believe might help bit someone repeatedly said really helped recover eating disorder it ’ s unlikely enough may reluctant tell family friend you ’ ll judge could told probably discus told doctor charity parent reassurance,SUBJECTIVE

"For me, I used the same strategy I use to tackle my daily anxiety. My anxiety used to be crippling to the point where if I missed one class in school it would just snowball into a whole month missed. I worked really hard with a therapist to overcome it so I definitely had some practice. I fell in love with the quote “feel the fear, do it anyway” meaning I would be anxious to the point where I could feel my heart in my throat and I would sweat through a hoodie, but eventually after walking into the classroom time and time again, the feeling started to shrink. I used that to help me with my restrictive eating habits. Kinda like meditating. I sat there and let all the voices yap and yap, but no matter how loud they were, I just let them pass and I still made sure to eat at least half of my plate. It took months, but I’m so glad I made the effort. My life is truly for the better now.

"My illness started with severe anxiety from smoking a once legal synthetic marijuana called ""spice"" or ""k2"".   Me and a friend at the time were young and dumb and decided to smoke grams of it daily (which is honestly a lot, especially because of how bad the stuff is) for about a month or two. As well as weed regularly until my symptoms appeared.   One night that friend had a seizure after us smoking more than we should have. Tells you how awful it is.  I guess it triggered some sort of PTSD in me towards anything even resembling marijuana. Or anything that gave even a slightly similar effect.   Anxiety just got worse and worse making it hard to sleep at night, and I stayed up for days on end at times. This all came out into my break from reality. Just a transition into insanity that sometimes is barely noticable and most of the time debilitating in terms of the social, mental and emotion aspects of my life. Though i feel lucid and can mask it, I imagine that it becomes immediately evident to anyone who meets me in real life.
